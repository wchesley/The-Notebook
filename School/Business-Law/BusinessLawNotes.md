- Formalism: `affirms absolute Morality`
    - Duty based view, if you have a duty, do it!
    - Categorical Imperative  
    - Social Contract - Idea that we all kinda have a contract with eachother, ie. i have my rights but no right to 'step' on your rights  
- Consequentialialism - Concerned with moral consequnces of actions
    - Utilitarianism
    - Protestant ethic

Ethics influences legal system: Is there a relationship between law and ethics? Yes.  

Sources of value for business ethics
- Legal regulation 
- Professional codes of Ethics - Professional code is career choice based ie. Internal Auditor
- Organizational codes of ethics - Publicly traded companies are required to have  code of ethics.  
- Individual values 

Legal regulation - Ethical rules drawn from the law
- Respect liberty and rights of others. (ie. free speech, but cannot yell fire in crowded theatre)
- Act in good faith 
- Exercise due care
- avoid conflics of interest
- Honor confidentiality 

Professional code of ethics
- Crtain professions have long traditions of codes of ethical conduct (CPA's have had a long standing code of ethics.)  
    - More recent professions have developed and adopted their own codes.   
- Ethical codes of organization are a form of *self regulation*.   

Organizational code of ethics
* Business have adopted ethical codes at the individual organizational level
* More important than creating a code:  
    * Effective implementation!  
    * Enforcement - consistency is key!  

Individual values: Self Examination:  
> ![Self Examination-Ethics](../../images\School\BusLawCh2ETHICS-Self_Examination.png) 
Should I do it?
* Is it right or wrong? 
* WIll I be proud if they found out
* How would I feel if everyone did it? 
* Will it cause harm? 
* Is it legal?   

Obstacles: 
* Profits vs. Ethics
* Group think - if everyone else is doing it...might as well...mob mentality
    * Individuals feel less responsible if the whole group is doing it.   
* Control of resources by non-owners (potential conflics of interest)
    * Managerial agents can manipulate resoures in their own interest. 
    * Self-dealing

Promoting  Business Ethics 
* Involve top management - have to have this, CEO as role model, rest of comapnay should follow suit 
    * Role model
    * Tone from the top
    * *Must believe in the expressed values*
* Open communication / Transparency
    * promotes trust  
    * Required due to complexity of information  
* Consideration of stakeholders
    * stakeholder Theory: Directors and managers must take into account it's stakeholders whose interests the corporations impacts. 
* Be Consistency! 

> Can an act be ethical but not legal?  Yes
This happens sometimes when American companies go overseas  

Can a business have a conscience?
* Personhood rights of a corporation have been recognized in the law. 
    * Corporation is an individual
* Does this mean that a corporation can have values and all the individual employees must agree with them? 
* What about laws for corporations that force individuals to violate religious values?

> - Entrepreneurs are well advised to be aware of the small-claims court as an effective place to resolve matters that do not involve large amounts of money.
> - The dollar limit jurisdiction of the courts varies by state from approximately $2,500 to $25,000. Small-claims courts have low court costs and simplified procedures. The informality of the proceedings speeds up the flow of cases. The services of a lawyer are not usually required, and some states do not allow lawyers to participate in these proceedings. Typical cases: 
> - clients who fail to pay;
> -    disputes with vendors;
> -    landlord-tenant problems, including security deposits;
> -    damage to clothing caused by cleaners or alterations;
> -    relatively minor personal injuries (e.g., dog bites);
> -    issues with contractors;
> -    failure to repair a vehicle or appliance properly.  
> The following claims *cannot* be brought in small claims courts: **divorce, guardianship, name change, bankruptcy, or actions for emergency relief (injunctions).**

## District courts
* Trial courts of the federal system. 
* One court in every state and the Distric of Colombia. 
* *Federal Rules of Civil Procedure:* Provide the details concerning procedures to be followed in federal court litigation. 

## Appellate courts
~~TODO: Get Geographical boundries for Appellate courts.~~  
> Fig 3.3 *The Federal Court of Appeals  

![Federal_Court_Of_Appeals](../../images/BusLawCh3_FedCourtOfAppeals.png)
* 12 courts of appeal
* Special court of appeals hears appeals from 
    * special courts. 
    * Administrative decisions
* Other courts have been created to handle the special subject matter.
    * Court of appeals for armed forces. 
* Texas is in the 5th circuit for court of appeals (apparently we rival the 9th district? (california - west coast?))

> General role of an appelate court is to: 
    Review questions of law. 

## Decisions by the US Supreme Court. 
*SCOTUS:* Supreme court of the united states.  
* review requires a petition for a *writ of Certiorari*
    * writ is submitted by losing party in court of appeals for permission to file an appeal with the US Supreme Court.
    * Supreme Court can decide if it wants to grant the writ, it's not a right, typicaly granted in cases of substantial federal importance.  
* Supreme court resolves 
    * cases involving major Constitutional issues 
    * interpretation of federal law. 
* Final judgments of hightes state court are reviewed only by SCOTUS.

## Power of judical review. 
* Judicial restraint vs. judical activism
* power should not be used except in unusual cases vs. Power should be used when the needs of society justify it. 
### US Supreme court has the ultimate power to invalidate actions by the President or Congress. 

>Judicial Restraint and Judicial Activism are not exclusive to a particular Judge. Many Judges may share aspects of both in their judicial philosophy. 

## Judical restraint: 
* Courts have a limited role. 
* conservative 
* Pragmatic approach to litigation.
* Societal changes through polical process rather than from court action 
* synonomous with: *Strict constructionism* or *judicial abstention*

## Judicial activism
* Liberal
* Courts have expansive role
* Policy directed / Result concious 
* Value oriented. 
* precedent  

> Sidebar 3.9 provides insight into the general alignment of the justices. It is important to understand, however, that this overall perspective does not translate into predictability. It is often fascinating to analyze each justice’s position as set forth in concurring and dissenting opinions.  

**Typical Alignment of Justices**  
|LEFT | 	SWING |	RIGHT |
|---|---|---| 
| Ginsburg |	Roberts |	Alito |
| Breyer 	|	| Thomas  |
| Sotomayor |	 | 	Gorsuch | 
| Kagan | | Kavanaugh |

## Nature of the judical process
1. Case to be decided. 
    * use existing statutes and precedents
    * create a law where none exist. 
    * Refusal to apply case law or find unconstitutional   
*Will ruling provide justice and a sound precedent?*  

~~Look at case 3.1 in book: Sebelius case regarding affordable care act.~~  
Case 3.1 was updated, see [Iancu v Brunetti](Cases/Case3.1_Iancu-v-Brunetti.md).  


## Review Questions and Problems
### Personnel

1. Judges and Justices What are the essential responsibilities of a trial judge?

2. Jurors Why have several states eliminated the requirement of unanimity in jury trials?

3. Lawyers Name the three critical roles a lawyer serves in society. Why have many lawyers and their business clients had such conflict in recent years?

### Organization of the Court System

1. *Subject Matter Jurisdiction*
    *  Mark, a citizen of Georgia, was crossing a street in Atlanta when he was struck by a car driven by David, a citizen of New York visiting Atlanta. The car was owned by David’s employer, a Delaware corporation that has its principal place of business in Atlanta, Georgia. Mark sues both David and the corporation in federal district court in Atlanta alleging damages in the amount of $500,000. Does the court have subject matter jurisdiction? Why or why not?

2. *State Courts*
    *  What role do reviewing or appellate courts play in the judicial process? How do they differ from trial courts?

3. *Federal Courts*
    *  XYZ makes and markets a product that it believes will help control weight by blocking the human body’s digestion of starch. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has classified the product as a drug and orders it removed from the market until it can evaluate its use through testing. XYZ disputes the FDA’s action and seeks to bring suit in the federal courts. Will the federal courts have jurisdiction to hear the case? Why or why not?

4. *Decisions by the U.S* 
    * Supreme Court Susan files a petition for certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court following an adverse decision in the Illinois Supreme Court on a claim arising under a breach of contract. What chance does Susan have of the Supreme Court granting the petition? What special circumstances would she need to show?

### The Power of Judicial Review

1. *Judicial Restraint* 
    * Define the power of judicial review. How do advocates of judicial restraint exercise that power?

2. *Judicial Activism* 
    * Define judicial activism. Compare and contrast judicial restraint and judicial activism.

3. *A Sample U.S. Supreme Court Case*
    *  Why are concurring and dissenting opinions important?

4. *The Nature of the Judicial Process*
    *  What are the forces that Justice Cardozo says shape the judicial process? How is the law made? In light of the liberal versus conservative divisions in the courts, are Cardozo’s observations still relevant?

### business discussions

1. You have spent the past four weeks away from work serving as a juror in a case deciding whether a pharmaceutical company should be held liable for the heart attack of a woman who took its painkiller, Oxxy-1. The lengthy case has taken a toll on your professional career, and you have many unanswered questions as jury deliberations begin.

    * Where does your duty lie in serving on a jury?

    * Are you protected against adverse employment action by your firm for missing work to serve on a jury?

    * How do you reconcile the woman’s prior heart palpitations from years ago with her recent attack? Was her heart already compromised before she began taking the painkiller Oxxy-1?

    * Why didn’t the pharmaceutical company withdraw the painkiller from the market at the first sign of a problem?

2. You are the president of a large corporation that is in the business of manufacturing, among other things, chemical products used to eradicate termites. You have just reviewed a confidential report, prepared by one of your top scientists, questioning the effectiveness of the product and the claims your business has been making to homeowners, pesticide treatment firms, and the general public. You have heard rumors that a lawsuit will be filed shortly against your corporation claiming that this product is ineffective.

    * Who should you turn to for advice?

    * Should you destroy the report?

   * In which court can a lawsuit be filed?

    * If you lose the lawsuit at trial, can you appeal?

## Exam 1 Review: 
lawyers first duty is administration of justice  
commercial speech is protected under first amendment; govt can limit it; and it may not be as extensive as right of individual  
under a minimum rationality approach a permissible state end is a legit goal of government.   
10th amendment reinforces federalism  
libel cases deal with printed defamatory falsehoods - tabloid magazines?  or slander (spoken defaming word)  
small claims courts do not require the services of a lawyer - think judge judy - not formal at all - limited by $$ amount asked for in claims  
lawyer is often involved in personal decision of clients  
judicial abstention; aka strict constructivism

# Chapter 4  
###### Exam 1 Due Tonight 9/19 by 11:59pm
[PowerPoint here](https://buffswtamu-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/wrchesley1_buffs_wtamu_edu/EWaskRa2XXNJobt0mhntZhoBDthfzjU_Qrm2fzhafbbFkg?email=chesley.walker%40gmail.com&e=Ca1Uaf)

## Litigation

Not the only way legal disputes are settled, there's also ADR (alternative dispute resolution) => Ch. 5

attornies that are really good in court room are called litigators or Trial attornies. 

Litigation helps the business community resolve actual disputes. (lawsuits)  
Lawsuits are a drain
- time
- money
- energy 
End goal of lecture: develop and understanding of litigation process.  

## Parties
- Plantiff 
    - Person who filed the suit. 
    - a **civil** action 
- defendant
    - Party being sued or 
    - Person against whom a criminal charge is filed by the state
- 3rd-Party Defendant: 
    - Brought in by the defendant
    - to complete determination of a controversy 

## Standing to sue
Do you really have a "dog" in this fight? 
- Entitled to have the court decide the dispute
- To Establish a standing, plaintiff must allege: 
    - Litigation involves a case or controversy 
    - Personal stake in the resolution of the controversy

Case 4.1
*Mayer v. Belichick*
605 F.3d 223 (3rd Cir.)
Issue: 
- Videotaping the new york jets coaches and players on teh field. 
- Purpose: capturing and stealing the new yourk jets signals and visual coaching instructions
 - The New England Patriots. 

 Personal Jurisdiction
 Court must have legal authority over an individual. 
 Court has to haev authority over the parties in the case
 - *in personum* over the person
    - Personal jurisdiction over the defendant obainted by: 
        - court summons
        - Service of Process 
 - *in rem?*
 - Long arm statuetes: Provision for the service of process beyond the boundaries of the state. 

## Class-Action Suits: 

Many people affected by an incident (red bull didn't give us all wings!)
- One or more plaintiffs file suit on their own behalf and on behalf of all other persons who may have a similar claim. 
- No one member of the class can make suing financially worthwhile (attornies typically take 1/3 of the reward in class action)

Pretrial procedures
1. Plaintiff files complaint
2. Complaints and summons served on defendant
3. Defendant files motion or answer with possible counterclaim and defenses
4. Court rules on motions - case could be decided here and never make it to trial. 
5. Plaintiff files reply to answer. 
6. attornets conduct discovery procedures
7. Parties may file motions for summary judgment or judgement on pleadings 
8. Court conducts pretrial confrence. 

## Pleadings
- they are: 
    - Legal documents
    - filed with a court
    - begin litigation process
- complaint: filed by plaintiff
- answer: filed by defendant
- Default: order entered by court when defendant does not respond in any way. 
- After getting answer plaintiff must reply
    - Admits or denies each alligation of the defendants counterclaims 

## Discovery 
Gather the Evidence
- Narrows the issues disputed by the parties. 
- Ensures results of lawsuits are based on the merits of the cotroversy. 
    - not an ability or skill of counsel 
- encourage settlement. 
- Get Evidence!!!! **<= THIS IS KEY!!**

## Discovery methods
- Interrogatories: 
    - written questions (like written interview)
- Request for production of documents; 
    - Ask other party to produce specific documents
- Depositions: 
    - Oral questions of the possible witness. 
    - asked by attornies, will have court reporter present, but witness is not under oath. trying to impeach the witness (catch them in a lie)
- Request for admisssion
    - if you would just agree to 'x' we don't have to bring it up in court again. 

## Discovery scope
- Discovery procedures are intended to be used freely by parties without courts supervision
- Judges provide a liberal interpretation of degree of discoverable information. 
- information is considered discoverable when it can lead to Evidence admissible during a trial. 
- expensive af **$$$$$$$**

in a survey of 1000 judges, abusive discovery was rated highest among the reasons for the hight costs of litigation. 

> 09/24/2019  

## Motions
- Statute of Limitations (SOL):
    - Defendant
    - Motion to dismiss suit
    - Law says plaintiff took too long to file
- Judgment on the pleadings
    - Decide case based only on the complaint and answer
- Summary Judgment    
    - Decide based on the pleadings and other evidence  

**TODO: Add figure 4.3 from textbook - Trial Steps - 2 pictures from slides/book **  

## Food for thought... 
"I consider a trial by jury as the only anchor yet devised by mn, by which a government can be held to the principles of its constitution"  -Thomas Jefferson

## Jury Selection  
- Jury Summons
- **Voir Dire**: Speaking the Truth
    - Selected jurors are called into jury box to conduct the examination
- Peremptory Challenge: No cause or reason needs to be given to excuse a prospective juror
- Strikes

### Case 4.2

> 564 U.S. _(2011)  
> *Wal-Mart Stores v. Dukes*  

One of the most expensive class action lawsuits ever.   
3 current or former walmar employees allege that the company discriminated against them on the basis,  
of their sex by denying them equal pay or promotions.  
**violates Title VII of Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended...**    
was not directed at corporate policy but local managers discretion over pay and promotion  
that was excersised disproportionately towards men.  
this was overturned as there weren't enough people to justify class action law suit.  
They took data from all walmart managers from accross all 50 states and had varying results.  
some women did better and some were worse off.  
Justice Ginsberg offerd this dissenting opinion:  
> She emphasized that the majority opinion "disqualifies the class at the starting gate"  
because it puts too much burden on the plaintiffs to show how their individual  
claims are sufficiently similar to form a class action.
>  
She was joined by Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan. 

#### Supreme court outlawed racial discrimination in peremptory challenges
    - batson v. kentucky, 476 US 79 (1986)
#### Gender discrimination is bannedd in the jury selection process 
    - J.E.B. v. Alabama
#### 

## Opening statements
- Attorneys make opening statements
- Plaintiff introduces evidence to establish truth of allegations made in the complaint
- Directed verdict: Motion by the defendant
- Lawyers summarize the evidence
- Jury instructions: judge informing the jury with the law 

## Burden of Proof 
- Criminal cases
    - Beyond reasonable doubt
- Civil cases - subject to two standards
    - Preponderance of evidence (less evidence requried to win, OJ was found not guilty for murder, but found to have owed money in the wrongful death civil suit brought before him for the same charge. Beyond Reasonable doubt burden was not met but Preponderance was)
    - Clear and convincing (More proof than Preponderance but less than reasonable doubt)  ex. Guardianship disputes (rare in civil cases, mostly Preponderance)

## Deciding the case
- Jury: 
    - Determine what the facts are 
    - apply the law as __**instructed by the judge**__ 
- Verdict: Decision by the jury announced in the courtroom when jury deliberations are over. 
- Judge will decide whether to accept the verdict or not. 

## Post trial issues
- Appellant: Party appealing. (Can be plaintiff or defendant)
- Appellee: Successful party in the trial court. 
- Petitioner: Party initiating the petition when a petition for certiorari is filed to the supreme court.
    - Respondant: Opponent party in the petition
##### If you are found not guilty in criminal case: the opposing party (the government) Cannot appeal the case.  Where as if the criminal loses the case, he can appeal. To be tried again would result in double jeapordy  

## Appellant Procedures
- Courts of appeal deal with the record of the proceedings in lower court. 
- Courts of appeal studies the issues, testimony and proceedings to determine: 
    - Whether prejudicial errors occured or 
    - Whether lower court reached and erroneous result
- Brief: Short description of the case by each party to the trial 

## Appellate Procedures
- Oral Arguement: Specified amount of time given to attorneys to explain their position to the court. (more like debate team) 
- Vote of the judges or justices impressions is taken. 
- Each judge prepares an opinion and circulates it among the other members. 
    - when a majority ... 

## Appellate Review: 
![Appellate Review](https://github.com/wchesley/The-Notebook/blob/master/images/School/BusLawCh4Litigation-AppellateReview.png)

## Enforcement of judgments and decrees
- Execution: 
    - Court official seizes some property of the debtor
    - Sells it at public auction
    - Applies the proceeds to the creditor's claims 
- Garnishment: involves having a portion of the debtors wages paid to the court, which in turn pays the creditor

## *Res Judicata* 
- Case has been decided on appeal
- Time for appeal has expired. 
- A cause of action finally determined by a competent court cannot be litigated by the parties anywhere. 
- Successive suits involving the same factual setting between the same parties cannot be made as dispute has been concluded. 
- Decision of the court is final and conclusive on all issues. 

# Chapter 5 - Alternative Dispute Resolution
> 09/24/2019  
[PowerPoint here](https://buffswtamu-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/wrchesley1_buffs_wtamu_edu/EY_iJjizoxRBoyGhn1swV7UB5LyPsPhv1Esh4PzDBG9n-g?email=chesley.walker%40gmail.com&e=z148mg)

> Conflicts leads to *disputes* when one party makes claim that the other denies. (usually from 2 differing points of view)

## Negotiation
- Process used to persuade or coerce someone.  
- Conflict Styles - we all have a dom conflict style but typically use all conflict styles. 
    - Avoidance (ie. ghosting)
    - Accommodate 
    - Competition 
    - Collaborate
    - Compromise
    
## Positional Negotiation
- Positional bargaining: used instinctively
- begins in competitive style
- Does *not* focus on underlying conflicts 

## Principled Negotiation
I. Communication  
II. Relationship  
III. Interests   
IV. Discuss all availabe options.   
V. which options are actually legit.   
VI. Consider the alternatives.   
VII. Commitment to the alternatives.    

## Alternative dispute resolution systems (ADR Systems)
- Litigation does not prevetnt the use of ADR. 
- Lawsuits are not required to use ADR methods. 
- Usage can be part of a contractual relationship between parties. (required by contract)
- Effective use can save costs associated with litigation. 

## Fig. 5.1 Scale of dispute resolution systems. 
> ![Dispute Scale](https://github.com/wchesley/The-Notebook/blob/master/images/School/BusLawCh5ADR-ScaleofDisputeSystems.png) 

## Arbitration
- ADR system 
- Disputing parties agree to have a third party decide the merits of the dispute
- Arbitrator: AUthorized to make decisions that are binding on the parties. 
- Helps parties avoid litigation expenses adn courtroom formalities. 
- Serves to ease congested court dockets. 
- Allows to submit several disputes to experts for solutions
- Submission: Act of referring the dispute to the Arbitrator
- Voluntary arbitration: Submission to arbitration by the parties. 
- Mandatory arbitration: Occurs when a statute or court requires parties to arbitrate. 
- Award: decision made by an Arbitrator

## Submission
- Submission by contract.  
    - Occurs when the parties enter into an agreement to arbitrate an exisiting dispute. 
- Parties can contractually agree to submit to arbitration all issues that arise in the future. 
- statuetes require Submission

## Factors that influence the selection of Arbitrators
- Get subject matter experts
- The number chosen is usually 3, but bigger cases may require more, smaller; less
- Authority over certain matters
    - Arbitrators authority is a topic of controversy and litigation. (currently disputed) 

## Case 5.1 Arbitrators Authority
- Case Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Antonio Jackson
- 130 S. Ct. 2772 (2010)
- Supreme court. 
- Issue: 
    - Jackson filed a race discrimination lawsuit in federal court instead of arbitrating his claim. 
        - he claimed that the agreement to arbitrate was unconscionable and unenforceable under nevada law. 

## Awards. 
- Decision by the Arbitrator
- Findings and reasons of the award must be disclosed if requried by the submission.  
- U.S. Supreme Court favors a broad scope of the arbitrators authority
- Final on all issues submited and enforceable by the courts 
- Not subject to judicial review on the merits of the descison 

## Federal Arbitration Act
- Encourages businesses to use ADR (encourages courts to do the same with cases that should be settled)
- Impact on Policy
    - FAA covers any arbitration clause in a contract that involves interstate commerce. 
    - Courts should enforce arbitration agreements. 
    - Federal policy favors arbitration of commercial disputes. 
- Impact on state laws. 
    - Some state laws specify that designated matters are not to be submitted for arbitration
    - Commerce Clause and supermecy clause of the US constitution invalidate state laws that deny arbitration 

## Case 5.2

## Statutorily Mandated Arbitration
- Certain statues requrie arbitration of specific subject matter 
- States statues require mandatory arbitration for certain types of disputes 
- Viable alternative for controlling court congestion
- ARbitrators are retired judges and practicing lawyers. 

# Chapter 6 The Constitution
The US Constitution provides the legal framework of our federal government and the authority it has to regulate business activities. There are **Seven** articles in the original constitution, the first three set up the legislative, executive adn judicial branches respectively. 
- Article I also sets up the Commerce Clause: The constitutional provision that gives the government power to regulate business. 
- Article IV ensures we are one nation rather than just individual states. This article also carries the full faith and credit clause and teh privileges and immunities clause. 
- Article V provides the process governing the amendment of the Constitution. 
- Article VI states the Constitution is the supreme law of the land. It also clarifies that federal laws take priority when there is conflicting state or local laws. 
- Article VII makes the Constitution effective up on ratification of the states, which occured in 1789
    - Two years later, 1791, the first 10 amendments were ratified, also known as the **Bill of Rights** 

There have been a total of 27 amendments made to the Constitution since 1791; of that only 17 were approved
- 12 of the 17 relate to how the federal government operates or who has the right to vote. 
- 5, beyond the bill of rights, are left, that substantially impact the government and the rights of individuals. 
    - of the 5, one was made to repeal another. The 18th amendment that made alcohol illegal and the 21st, which repealed it. 

## The First 14 Amendments
1. Freedom of Speech, press, religion and petition
2. Right to Keep and bear arms. 
3. conditions for the quarters of soliders
4. right of search and seizure
5. provisions regarding prosecution
6. right to a speedy trial, witnesses, ect...
7. right to a trial by jury
8. excessive bail and cruel and punishment
9. rule of construction of the constitution
10. rights of states
11. state sovereign immunity
12. electoral college
13. abolishment of slavery and involuntary servitude. 
14. du process and equal protection

## Basic Concepts of the Constitution
- Seperation of powers
    - seperates powers between federal, state and local governments 
    - seperation of powers is also known as federalism; a concept that recognizes that each level of government has a separate and distinct role to play. 
    - 10th Amendment reserves some powers to the states and the people. 
        - Congress may not impair a state governments ability to function in the federal government. 
        - State government may not limit the federal government's exercise of powers. 
- Supremecy Clause
    - Article VI makes the constitution the supreme law of the land, federal law is supreme over states law, state law is supreme over local law. 
    - Under the supremecy clause, courts can be called upon to decide if a state law is invalid because it conflicts with federal law. 
- Preemption 
    - if a federal law preempts a subject, then any state law that attempts to regulate the same activity is unconstitutional under the supremecy clause. 
    - preemption applies to federal statutes and the rules and regulations of federal agencies. 

## The Commerce Clause
- Found in article I section 8: "The Congress shall have power... to regulate Commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the indian tribes." 
- Regulation of foreign commerce
    - power is vested exclusively in the federal government, and it extends to all aspects of foreign trade. 
        - States attempts to regulate are generally unconstitutional however a state may regulate activities that relate to foreign commerce if such activities are conducted entirely within the states boundries. 
- Regulation of interstate commerce
    - One of the most important decisions made by the early supreme government was *Gibbons v. Ogden (1824)* which stated that the Commerce Clause prohibits one state from interfering with commerce that crosses state lines.
- Impact on Interstate commerce
    - in the first half of the 20th century, by a series of judicial decisions, the power of teh federal government expanded through interpretation to include not only persons *engaged* in interstate commerce, but also activities *affected* by interstate commerce
    - as a result of the supreme courts decisions the power of congress over commerce is very broad, it is hard to imagine a factual situation involving business transactions that the federal government cannot regulate. 
- Limitation on federal authority
    - Federal government's power to regulate commerce had become so broad in the 20th century that, here in the 21st century that the focus turns to whether ther is any limitation on this authority. 
- Contract Clause
    - Article I section 10 of the constitution says "No state shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts" 
        - Does not apply to the federal government, which does in fact frequently enact laws and adopt regulations that affect existing contracts. 
        - States cannot enact laws that impact the rights of existing contracts. The original contract would hold up and only newly created contracts would be affected by the new law. 

## Amendments and Basic Protections
1. Basic constitutional rights are not absolute. 
2. The extent of any limitation on a basic constitutional guarantee depends upon the nature of the competing public policy. 
    - cases involving the Bill of Rights almost always require courts to strike a balance either between some goal or policy of society adn the constitutional protection involved. 
3. Constitutional guarantees exist in order to remove certain issues from the political process and the ballot box. **They exist to to protect the minority from the majority.**
4. Constitutional rights vary from time to time and may be narrowly interpreted during emergencies such as war or civil strife.  
    - even during peace time, constitutional principles are constantly reapplied and reexamined. 

## First Amendment Protections
- Freedom of Religion
    - Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion (**Establishment clause**) or prohibiting the free exercise thereof (**Free exercise clause**)
- Freedom of Speech
    - aka freedom of expression, covering both written and spoken word. 
    - the most absolute of all constitutional garuntees, thought not entirely absolute
        - *Chaplinsky v. State of New Hampsire* (1942) the court held that "fighting words" or words that inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace are not subject to first amendment protections. The court also held that such utterances are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality. 
        - *Brandenburg v. Ohio* the court held that to be unprotected the speech must be an incitement to imminent lawless action
        - **Obscenity** is also unprotected, to determine if speech is obscene the following test was derrived: 
            1. Wheter teh work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest in sex. 
            2. Whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by applicable state law
            3. Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value (*Miller v. California* 1973)
        - With the exception of Child pornography, very little material is considered obscene in the US. 
        - **Overbredth doctrine** which provides that a regulation of speech can sweep too broadly and prohibit protected as well as non-protected speech. A regulation of speech is unconstitutionally overbroad if it regulates a substantial amount of constitutionally protected expression.
        - **Commercial Speech** up until the 1970's commercial speech was not protected under the first amendment. 
            - Freedom of speech for corporations may not be as extensive as the right of an individual. However a government cannot limit commercial speech without a compelling state interest expressed to justify the restriction. 
- Freedom of Press
    - Publication is the only business group given explicit constitutional protection. 
    - the press cannot print anything without liability however; **Prior Restraints** state that if the press publishes anything illegal or libelous, it has the liability for doing so, the liabilty extends to criminal and civial charges for damages. 
    - **Defamation** (tort known as **libel**) is used to recover damages as a result of printed defamation of character. 
## Second Amendment: The right to Possess guns
    - 2nd amendment states "A well regualted militia, being necessary to the security for a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed" 
    - very few supreme court opinions involving the second amendment
## Fifth amendment: Takings Clause
    - zoning and other regulations place limits on property to protect some owners form being harmed by other owners. 
- Eminent Domain
    - Governments power to take resources (usually land, but this is not always the case) from private owners for public use, upon the payment of just compensation.
        - Public use is best defined as use by the public, so public roads, parks, public building, sewage treatment plant or landfill. Over the years, public use's definition has changed to be more of public purpose, that is any purpose that benefits the public, such as electric companies.  
        - Just compensation is generally defined, by the courts, as the market value. In most cases the government offers just compensation to the owner and a negotiation follows and an amount is agreed upon. If an amount cannot be agreed upon, the owner may bring this before a jury to determine a just compensation. 
## Fourteenth AMendment: Equal Protection and Due Process of Law
- "No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty or property, wihtout due process of law, nor deny to any person within it's jurisdiction the equal protection of laws"
    - **Due Process of Law** Describes fundamental principles of liberty and justice. It means the government cannot act in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. 
        - does not affect private individuals orcorporations, including public utilities, only governmental bodies. 
        - Incorporations Doctorine: Starting in 1925, when the supreme court began applying various portions of the first 8 amendmentss to the states using the due process clause, it incorporated, through the 5th (federal) and 14th (state) amendments that the all of the constitutionally garunteed freedoms are applicable to the state governments regulation of our personal and professional lives. 
    - **Equal Protection** embodies the ethical idea that law should not treat people differently without a satisfactory reason. In deciding cases using that clause to challenge state and local laws, courts use three distinct approaches
        1. Minimum rationality 
            - a law will survive an equal protection challenge if it has a *rational* and *permissable* state end. (permissable being not prohibited by the constitution and a legitimate goal of government.)
            - These laws typically involve economic issues and social legislation such as welfare laws. 
        2. Strict Scrutiny
            - a classification will be a denial of equal protection unless the classification is necessary to achieve a *compelling* state purpose. The law must serve important governmental objectives and the classification must be substantially related to achieving these objectives. 
            - applies to classifications directed at race, disabled persons, national origin, legitimacy of birth and cases involving fundamental rights. 
        3. Quasi-strict scrutiny
            - cases that fall between minimum rationality and strict scrutiny under go quasi-strict scrutiny. 
            - Applies to cases directed at gender. 

# Chapter 7: Property Rights

**Property:** The legal right to exclude others from resources that are origionally possessed  
or are acquired without force, theft or fraud.  
Property is *absolute* but not *infinite*, it's boundries can be *ambiguous*

### Inclass bonus Notes: 
some countries fighting over treasure? London, Hungary and Lebonon 
sliver items
told they were coming from; 
> *Provenance:* the chronology of the ownership, custody or location of historical object.  
Guy who knew where silver originated was killed
silver items were taken to new york for auction
meuseam in LA attempted to curate the silver (from ancient rome) 

**Time team special 34 - mystery of roman treasure**

does the silver have legal provenance? 

Legally exported from lebonon; there were a number of descrepeciens in export docs. docs were forged?! damn son
no valid docs tracing ownership acusing americans of selling stolen goods 



# Chapter 8 Contract formation

If you do 'A', I'll do 'B'
I will work for you for $15/hr

- Enable buyers and sellers to: 
    - account for future risks 
    - have confidence in exhcanging valueables. 
    - have confidence in what we are doing.   
All promises are legal contracts?! Hell no!

## So there's another way out of a contract? 
- Efficient Breach  


# Chapter 9 Torts
**Tort: Any civil wrong other than breach of contract**
- Note: this is a civil misdead, so it's between private parties, usually this is not a crime but it very well can be. `ie: assault and battery` also remember that the burden of proof is much much lower than in criminal cases. 
Torts law limits how people act and use their resources.  

## Categories of Torts 
- Intentional: intentionally performing a wrong against some one (ie I point a deadly weapon at someone)
	- Intent: Desire to bring about certain results (does not have to be your planned results)

	- Battery: illegal touching of another (ie. stabbing someone, though just threatening with a knife is assault, stabbing is battery)
		- Case 10.1 Assault & Battery *Harper vs. Winston County*
			- Sandra Wright fired her employee, sherry harper. Harper sued wright claiming that assault and batter had been commited. THe court granted Summary judgement in favor of Wright. Is Harpers appeal that assault and batter has been commited valid?

		- `872 F.Supp. 2d 369 (D. N.J. 2012)`
			- Deborah Ehling worked at monmouth-ocean hospital. Ehling did not invite any of her coworkers to be her facebook friends. Ehling filed lawsuit for invasion of privacy claiming that supervisors at MONOC accessed her facebook wall without consent. Does MONOC's actions imply invasion of privacy. 
	- False imprisonment: intentional unjustified confinement of a nonconcenting person. 
	- Malicious prosecution: Causing someone to be arrested criminally without proper grounds 
	- Tresspass: entering another's land without consent or to remain there after being asked to leave.

	- persay someone rents a car; rental agreements explicitly states that the car can only be used withing the US. the Buff takes his rental car into mexico for a beer run. This is conversion as the contract specified that the car cannot leave the US. 
- Defamation: Publication of untrue statements about another that hold up that individuals reputation to ridicule. 
- Fraud: intentional misrepresentation of a material fact that is relied upon by someone to his or her injury. to have fraud, the wrong has to be intentional, ie you can't accidentally turn back your cars odometer. (That is a LIE! Sauromon has always been our friend AND ally)  

## Interference with business relations 
- Injurious falsehood: publication of untrue statements that disparage teh business owner's product or it's quality. (talkin shit business to business, lies about the business not the individual) 
- intentional interference with contractual relations. (pro athletes experience this. ie opposing team bidding for player before contract is up)  
	- Raiding another company for employees 
	- Interfering with contract of merger of one company with another (companies may have bidding wars with another but if a contract is in place and signed, then no one can interfear) 
	
## Negligence 
- Unreasonable behavior that causes injury. 
- Elements: 
	- Duty of care (employee sees spill and does nothing to clean it up or mark the spill) 
	- Breach of Duty (bear saw the spill and did nothing, there we have a breach) 
	- Causation in fact (Bear decided to not clear up spill, is that why the buff slipped and fell?)
	- Proximate causation (how direct was this thing; bear didn't clean up spill, buff fell in it; fairly direct) 
	- Acutal injury (Buff broke a leg!)

> Business discussions

1.You have spent the past four weeks away from work serving as a juror in a case deciding whether a pharmaceutical company should be held liable for the heart attack of a woman who took its painkiller, Oxxy-1. The lengthy case has taken a toll on your professional career, and you have many unanswered questions as jury deliberations begin.

* Where does your duty lie in serving on a jury?

* Are you protected against adverse employment action by your firm for missing work to serve on a jury?

* How do you reconcile the woman’s prior heart palpitations from years ago with her recent attack? Was her heart already compromised before she began taking the painkiller Oxxy-1?

* Why didn’t the pharmaceutical company withdraw the painkiller from the market at the first sign of a problem?

2.You are the president of a large corporation that is in the business of manufacturing, among other things, chemical products used to eradicate termites. You have just reviewed a confidential report, prepared by one of your top scientists, questioning the effectiveness of the product and the claims your business has been making to homeowners, pesticide treatment firms, and the general public. You have heard rumors that a lawsuit will be filed shortly against your corporation claiming that this product is ineffective.

* Who should you turn to for advice?

* Should you destroy the report?

* In which court can a lawsuit be filed?

* If you lose the lawsuit at trial, can you appeal?

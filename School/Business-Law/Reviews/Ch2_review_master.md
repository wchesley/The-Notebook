Consequentialism A headline from The Wall Street Journal read “U.S. Companies Pay Increasing Attention to Destroying Files.” The article discussed how many companies are routinely shredding files in the ordinary course of business to prevent future plaintiffs from obtaining the files and finding incriminating evidence. Is this practice unethical? Evaluate.

## Achieving an Ethical Business Corporation

The Obstacles

A Newsweek article on business ethics concludes, “Even in today’s complex world, knowing what’s right is comparatively easy. It’s doing what’s right that’s hard.” Explain why this statement may be true in modern corporate decision making.

In 2010, average CEO pay was 319 times higher than the average employee’s pay, according to the Institute for Policy Studies. In 1980, CEO pay was only 42 times higher. Discuss possible reasons for this tremendous increase in CEO pay and analyze the ethical implications.

The Steps Another article from The Wall Street Journal carries the headline “Tipsters Telephoning Ethics Hot Lines Can End Up Sabotaging Their Own Jobs.” Discuss why whistle-blowing is unpopular within the corporation. Apply to your discussion what sociologist Robert Jackall said about a subordinate’s loyalty to supervisors within the corporation. Is whistle-blowing an appropriate subject for corporate ethics codes?

The Rewards Why are formal legal rules alone not an adequate ethical system for business?

As the chief executive officer of a Silicon Valley software company, you become aware that your chief competitor is working on a new computer program that will revolutionize interactive voice-based applications.

Is it ethical for you to hire away from your competitor a secretary who may have overheard something that will be useful to you?

Is it ethical for you to have someone hunt up and read everything published by your competitor’s programmers in case they may have let slip something that will help you?

2. The research director of PharmCo, a midsize pharmaceutical company, tells top management of an important new discovery. After years of effort, one of the company’s research teams has discovered a drug that will reverse pattern baldness, the leading cause of male hair loss. The potential for profit from such a drug is enormous, but the director cautions that two of the eight principal researchers on the team believe that the drug may also increase the possibility of potentially fatal cerebral aneurysms in a very tiny percentage of users.

If follow-up animal studies of the new drug do not show significant side effects, would it be ethical for the company to tell the two researchers to keep quiet about their concerns?

Is it ethical to put animals at risk in order to test the drug’s safety?

Many poor men in the world will be unable to afford the new drug if PharmCo sets the price too high.

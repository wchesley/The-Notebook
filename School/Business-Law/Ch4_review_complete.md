business discussions

1. You are the manager of a used car firm known as Reliant Motor Company. Your lawyer has called to tell you that John Doe, a customer you have been dealing with for several months, has filed a lawsuit against the firm. The customer claims the vehicle he purchased is a lemon and no longer even operates. You knew the vehicle was not in the best of condition at the time of sale, but you believe the buyer caused most of the problems by taking the vehicle “off road” several times. You are not looking forward to discovery or trial in this case. You have several questions.

    How does discovery work?

    Can you be required to testify twice in a deposition and at trial?

    Should you shred all documents you have about this case? You know that some of the documents will not put the firm in the best light.

You wonder what will happen at trial. Will it be like what you have seen on TV or in the movies?

2. You are the owner of a small firm that manufactures lawn mowers. While using one of your products, a person suffers severe injury and now is suing, claiming that your product was negligently designed because it did not adequately protect the user. You have no experience with the legal system. You learn that lawyers charge as much as $250 per hour and must be paid whether they win or lose their cases. You are surprised at what must happen before a trial can occur to determine who is at fault. First, your lawyer may move to dismiss the case on jurisdictional grounds. If that fails, both sides will take costly depositions of likely witnesses. You will have to turn over reams of internal documents related to the design of your mower. Each side also will have to pay several hundred dollars per hour for experts as the lawyers prepare the case. These experts will have to be paid again when they testify at trial. As the time for the trial approaches, each side will spend money trying to discern the most sympathetic type of jury. Years after the lawsuit was first filed, the parties will be sitting in the courtroom waiting for jury selection to begin. More money will have been spent defending this case than the plaintiff was seeking when the lawsuit was first filed. Many questions come to mind:

    Should you have settled the case at the beginning?

    Has your attorney been getting rich at your expense?

    Is discovery more of a burden than a help?

# Getting to Yes

## Don't Bargain over Positions
Each side takes a position, argues for it, and makes concessions to reach a compromise. This is best portrayed by the vendor-customer relationship, think second hand store in America for this. Essentially the two parties are debating price of an object. This kind of negotiation depends on successively talking and then giving up a sequence of positions.   
Taking positions can serve some useful purposes in a negotiation: 
- tells the other side what you want
- provides an anchor in an incertain and pressured situation
- it can (eventually) produce teh terms of an acceptable agreement

Those purposes can be served in other ways, positional bargaining fails to meet the 3 criteria of a good negotiation: 
- producing a wise agreement 
- It should be efficient 
- It should improve (or at least not damage) the relationship between the parties

### Arguing over positions produces unwise outcomes
When negotiatiors bargain over positions, they tend to lock themselves into those positions. 
- The more you clarify your position and defend it; 
  - The more commited you become to your position
- The more you try to convince the other side of the impossability of changing your opening position
  - The more difficult it becomes to do so

Your Ego becomes identified with your position, you have a new interest in "saving face"-in reconciling future action wiht past positions-making it less likely that any agreement will reconcile the parties' original interests. 

The more attention given to positions, the less attention is devoted to meeting the underlying concerns of the parties. Agreement becomes less likely. Any agreement reached may reflect a mechanical splitting of the difference between final positions rather than a solution carefully crafted to meet the legitimate interests of the parties. Resulting in an agreement less agreeable than what could have been, or worse, no agreement at all. 

### Arguing over positions is inefficient
Bargaining over positions creates incentives that stall settlement. In positional bargaining you try to imporve the chance that any settlement reached is favorable to you, by starting at an extreme position, stubbornly holding onto it, by deceiving the other parties and by making small concessions only as necessary to keep the negotiation going. This holds true for both sides of the coin. 

Decision making is time consuming and difficult at best. Where eache decision not only involves yielding further, a negotiatior has little incentive to move quickly. Delay tatics like dragging feet, stonewalling or walking-out become more commonplace. All of which increases time and costs of reaching an agreement, as well as the risk of no agreement being made. 

### Arguing over positions endangers an ongoing relationship
Positional bargaining becomes a contest of wills, with each side asserting what they will or will not do. The task of jointly finding an acceptable solution becomes a battle, with each side trying to get the other to agree to their side through sheer force of will.  
Should one side bend to the other, anger and resentment typically build up in the yielding side. Positional barganing strains and sometimes shatters the relationship between parties. This issue only compounds with itself as the number of parties involved increases (for computer science people, think an algorithm that runs in n<sup>2</sup> time). 

### Being nice is no answer
Many people recognize the high cost of positional bargaining and will try to avoid or mitigate them by adopting a softer style of negotiating. The following table outlines two styles of positional bargaining, sof and hard. 

| **Problem** <br>*Positional Bargaining:*| <br>*Which game should you play?* |
| --- | ---|
| Soft | Hard | 
| Participants are friends | Participants are adversaries. |
| The goal is agreement | The goal is victory | 
| Make concessions to cultivate the relationship | Demand concessions as a condition of the relationship | 
| Trust others | Distrust others | 
| Be soft on the people and the problem | Be hard on the problem and the people | 
| Change your position easily | Dig into your position |
| Make offers | Make threats | 
| Disclose your bottom line | Mislead your bottom line | 
| Accept one sided losses to reach an agreement | Demand one-sided gains as the price of agreement | 
| Search for the single answer: the one they will accept | Search for the single answer: the one you will accept | 
| Insist on agreement | Insist on your position | 
| Try to avoid a contest of will | Try to win a contest of will | 
| Yield to pressure | Apply pressure | 

The soft negotiating style emphasizes the importance of building and maintaining a relationship, this is most common within families and friends.  
Soft negotiating style is directly countered by the hard style. If your response to sustained hard positional bargaining, is sustained soft positional bargaining, you will most likely loose the shirt off your back. 

### There is an alternative
If you don't like the choice between hard and soft positional bargaining, change the game. The "game" of negotiating takes place on two levels: 
- Negotiation that addresses the subject directly. 
  - Negotiating a salary, rent, raise, ect...
- The procedure for dealing with the substance. 
  - The "Meta-game". It escapes most peoples notice until dealing with someone from distinctly different cultural backgrounds. 

Each move you make in a negotiation not only solves the substance of the issue (Salary, rent, raise...) it also defines how the rules of the game are structured. Whether these 'meta-game' decisons are conciously made or not, you are negotiating procedural rules with every move you make, even if those moves appear exclusively concerned with substance.  
The answer to the question of Hard vs. Soft positional bargining is *neither*; change the game. Harvard suggests the following alternative: *principled negotiation* or *negotiation on the merits*. Which can be boiled down into 4 points: 
- People: Separate the people from the problem
- Interests: Focus on interests, not positions
- Options: Invent multiple options looking for mutual gains before deciding what to do. 
- Criteria: Insist that the result be based on some objective standard.

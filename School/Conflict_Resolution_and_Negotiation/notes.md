# Notes

## Types of Negotiation *Many paths to a deal*

There are two primary types of negotiation: 
- **Distributive**
  - Negotiation in which parties compete of the distribution of a fixed sum value. Key question is distributed negotiation is "who will claim the most value?". Gain by one side is made at the expense of the other. 
- **Integrative**
  - Negotiation in which parties cooperate to achieve maximum benefits by integratin their interests inot an agreement. These deals are about creating value and claiming it. (examples could be staring a company/group investment?)

### Distributive
- *zero-sum* or *win-lose* style negotiation
- Relationships or Reputation typically don't mean much in terms of the making the deal
  - example: A person moving to a new city and buying a home. They won't know the seller and (odds are) won't know them after the deal is made. 
- Infomation is critical, the more you know about the other party and the less they know about you, the better. 
- Key points for success in Distributive negotiation: 
  - First offer can become a strong psychological anchor point, one that sets the bargaining range. Could make or break you, depending on what you know. 
  - DO NOT disclose any significant information about your circumstances-including why you want to make a deal, your real intersts or business constraints, your preferences among issues or options or the point at which you'd walk away from the table. It is advantageous, however, to let the other side know that you have good options if the deal falls through
  - Information about the other side can benefit you (inverse of above point). Learn as much as possible about the other side's circumstances and preferences-including why they want to make a deal, their real interests and business contraints ect... 
  - Exploit what you learn about the other side in setting your first offer or demand.
  - Don't overshoot. If you claim aggressively or greedily the other side may walk away. 

### Integrative 
- Parties cooperate to achieve maximum benefits by inegrating their interest into an agreement while also competing to divide the value. 
- For Integrative negotiations, you need to be good and creating AND claiming value in the deal. 
- Some argue this is *win-win* but in reality that almost never happens, this is more like trade-offs to get what you value most from the deal. 
- Sometimes both parties interests don't compete at all, making negotiations easier
- Often many items or issues to be negotiatied not simply price, delivery date, or any other single issue. Opportunities for creativity abound here. 
  - Mark Gordon (coined the term "Collaborative Bargaining" for this), says that parties should look for creative options anb not focus on which concessions to make. "You have to believe that it's in your interest to look for ways to benefit your negotiationg counterpart. Your goal is no to hurt them, but to help them at a little cost to yoursellf-and have them help you at little cost to them. The more creative you are at coming up with things that are good for both of you, the happier both of you will be" <br><sub><a href="https://hbsp.harvard.edu/product/C9903A-PDF-ENG">"Win-Win with Mark Gordon"</a>, Harvard Management Communication Letter, March 1999</sub>
  - This creativity is ONLY possible if *both* parties understand their own, and eachothers interests. 
  - *Getting to Yes* does a great job of shifting peoples focus onto Integrative Negotiations
- Inversly from Distributive negotiations, information sharing is key to integrative negotiations. 
- Key points include: 
  - Provide significant information about their circumstances
  - explain why you want to make a deal
  - talke about their real interests or business constraints
  - reveal and explain in general terms their preferences among issues or options
  - consider and reveal any additional capabilities or resources they have that might meet the other side's interests and could be added to the deal. 
  - Use what they learn to find creative options that will meet the interests of both parties. 

## Multiple Phases and Multiple Parties
Typically people think of negotiations as being one-on-one when in reality; this is rarely the case. Negotiations most often involve multiple parties (or several people from two parties) and take place in steps, or phases.

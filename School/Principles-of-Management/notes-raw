*    Inverview Diverse Canadites
*    prevent discrimination based on race, gender, Sexual orientation, country of origin
*    active effor to increase diversity in work place. 
*    outreach campaingns. 

Affirmative Action is a law (policy) regarding diversity.
main focus is race and gender
main premesis: equal oppertunities. 
*    companies are required to give everyone equal oppertunity and access regarding employment. 
*    applies to all companies over 50 people (canot do quotas based hiring system: they are illegal)
*    cannot hire based on gender/race no matter what ie. hiring a less qualified cannidate based on race alone. 
you can get away with this if and only if both cannidates are equally qualified

Diversity: 
* Doesn't need a policy to be enforced. happens naturally
* not law
* all about promoting success

Done again with John and Jamal
    Almost twice as many call backs for John
###### Research done aprox 2011 TODO: find and link study

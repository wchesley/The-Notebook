## Getting MEAN Chapter 01

back end web dev class but really it's more full stack. 

MEAN
* MongoDB - The database; document datastore, largely used to store JSON Like objects
* Express - Backend Framework - Node web server enviroment 
* Angular - FrontEnd framework - Interchageable with ReactJS
* Node - Web server and server-side code execution enviroment
* Why? - End to end javascript (cause you don't know enough already)

assignment 0 is a micro clone of https://www.name-generator.org.uk
     not as complex as this, can dumb it down a bit, I am thinking one input and see what rhymes with that? will need
     rhyming database? CSS optional; example on CodePen.io userID: Jeffry Babb

Assignment 1 will be a modified version of CH4 code found [in this repo](https://github.com/simonholmes/getting-MEAN.git)
instead of loc8tr we'll find pizza places. 

>Full Assignment Requirements  
## Assignment 1 - Starting Out with Node, Express, and Pug

Chapters 3 and 4 in Simon Holmes' book start out with the basic version of our author's example app: loc8r.

It is imperative that you work through these chapters methodically.  Among the things you'll learn are:

* Installing Node and NPM
* Installing Express
* Utilizing Pug
* Transforming the basic Express project template into an MVC template
     * Creating Pug template views
     * Creating controllers to work with routing and logic
* What does MVC mean? - Model View Controller
* Using Git (and for us, Github)
* Deploying to Heroku

### Tasks

Near the end of chapter four, Simon shows us two important things:

* how to work with mixins and includes to develop reusable aspects of your Pug templates
* how to work with data within your Pug template

What we need to do is modify Simon's code to create a different list of items (rather than locations for wifi).  Here is what you need to do:

* Obtain Simon's chapter 4 code and git pull or download it.
* Modify the code to include an additional list page of three (3) select pizza restaurants in Amarillo and/or Canyon (this means another tab in the navigation for the pizza places)
* Modify the code to develop attributes for each restaurant (they will be different than what Simon uses for locations).
* Modify and/or Copy and Modify the layout.pug, location-info.pug, and locations-list.pug files to accomplish these tasks.
* Since Simon is using a 3rd-party Bootstrap theme, you should do so as well.  The results may not be what you expect, but I want you to experiment
* Create an additional mixin that will also shade the background of each item in the locations-list for your pizza restaurants different colors depending on their rating.

### What to Submit

You will submit the following:

    1. Your Github URL of the repository you make for this project
    1. Your C9 project URL
    1. Your Heroku app URL
    1. Your Express Project ZIPPED up and submitted here.


status.vatsim.org? - Babb's project
define schema by clienttype - Pilot or Controller. 
Some data points are only defined for pilots and not controllers. 
some data points are shared by each clienttype. 
controllers have a rating, pilots might? 
only points have transponder, 
anything beginning wiht plan is all pilots stuff
only controllers has ATIS message.

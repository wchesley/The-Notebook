Conversions: 
converting mm^3 to m^3

### Temperature
Measure of avg kinetic energy of molecules or particles that make up a sample 

have to have starting point to reference back to later. ie. 0 degrees or sea level for example 

Kelvin, Farenhti and celcius. are the main units of temp used here 

Kelvin scale is unique in that its zero point is the coldest possible temps, absolute zero. which is the temp at which there is no thermal energy at all. as such the point 0 kelvin is the lowest possible temperature reading on the kelvin scales. 

there is 100K diff between F and C; This is becuase there is a 1:1 relationship to Celcius, K = C + 273.15
for Celcius to Farenhti is **C = 1/9(F-32)**

Convert normal human body temp: 98.6F to Kelvin and Celcius
will have to convert to celcius first: 

```
C = 1/9(98.6-32) = 37C
K = 37 + 273.15 = 310.2K
```

### Measured numbers and uncertainty

pg21-22 in textbook; there is always some uncertainty about any measured quanitty; 

ie. 12 eggs is certain number or 36.65ml is a measured value. in the second one there is some uncertainty. instruments will dictate accuracy to some degree 

### Siginificat figures. 
Def: digits in a measure or calcuated number which are meaningful. 
if you read a scale that shows 1.379gs of weight, is 1.37900gs the same? no because the scale cannot measure that small. We'd say that 1.379gs is accuratly reported to 4 significt figs. 

Rule 1: all non-zero digits are significt;
1.379gs has 4 significt digits;  

rule 2: leading zeros are non-significt

Rule 3: Zeros between non zeros digits are significt

Rule 4: Trailing zeros may or may not be significt. if a reported number is written with a decimal then the trailing zeros are significt. if however; no decimal is written in the number we interpre the trailing zeros as insignificant. 
1200**.** has 4 significt figs
where as 1,200 has 2 significt figures

example problems:  count all significt digits
A. 100001 **5**
B. 10000 **1**
C. 0.00001 **1** *Leading zeros are insignificant* 
D. 0.000101 **3**
E. 0.000100 **3**
F. 2.5700 **5**
G. 2.47 **3**
H. 25700. **5**
I. 2.00 x 10^3 **2** take out of scientific notation first, then find significt figures; the answer will be the same as in scientific notation formate but it's easier to see written out. 
* last digit is usually estimated, there is generally a +/- to account for error* 


### Exact numbers; 

Unlike measured numbers, some numbers are known with absolute certainty 
ex: if I count 10 apples in my fridge, this is an **Exact number** or there is 100cm in 1 meter. These are exact numbers. 
Formulas are the same way^^
Note: Exact numbers are said to have infinite significt digits. 

Example Promble: 1.8 Page 24 in text: 
a 1.3In - Measured: 2 sigfig
b. 203m - Measured: 3 sigfig
c. 203 pennies - Exact: infinite sigfig
d. 2030m - Measured: 3 sigfig
e. 2.030 x 10^3m - measured 3 sigfig
f. 1cm = 0.01m - exact: infinite sigfig


### Calculating with significt figures

the result of teh calculation cannot be more exact than the inputs that were utilized ot generate it. 
#### Multiplication && Division: The final result must have the same number of sigfig as that of the measured value with the fewest significt figures that was utazlied in the calculation (round when nescessary)
as accurate as possible but not more than given inputs. 
won't always have to drop the extra digits, sometimes you need to add some! ie: 12.0/2.00 = 6 should be reported as ** 12.0/2.00 = 6.00** 

#### Addition && Subtraction: the result will have the same number of decimal places as the measured input with the fewest decimal places.
so in 12.43 + 1.23577 - 34.66585, we'd only us 2 decimal places due to 12.43 only going to tens place. 

Example 1.10 (Page 28) - lable all significt digits in the result of the following equations: 
A. 3.10002/3.78  || .820 = 3
B. 12.907 x 2.341  || 30.22 = 4
C. 37.2 + 12.887 + 8.71043  || 58.8 = 1  
D. 4.37 - 1.201  || 3.17 = 3

order of operations still applies when Multiplication and Division and Addition and Subtraction are combined. **PEMDAS** STILL HAVE TO FOLLOW SIGFIG RULES
NEVER ROUND NUMBERS UNTIL YOU ARRIVE AT RESULT - Keep all digits but remember which ones were the significant ones!!!

## Types of Bonds: 

### Debentures
- Unsecured long-term debt
- Riskier than secured bonds but have higher interest rate
- No firm assets are put up as collateral, allowing the firm to issue debt and still preserve some ability to borrow in the future 

### Subordinated Debentures
- if firms have more than one outstanding Debentures, they might reorganize it into a hierarchy
	- some Debentures are given a `Subordinated standing in case of insolvency`
	- The claims on this debt are only satisified **AFTER** claims of secured debt and unsubordinated debentures have been satisified. 

### Mortgage Bonds
- Bond secured by lien on real property 
- Usually value of real property is greater than the value of the bond 
- in the case of forclosure: 
	- allows trustee's to sell property and distribute resulting funds to bondholders 
	- bond trustee is usually a banking institution 
	- should sale of property not cover the bonds bondholders become general creditors for the remaining portion of unpaid debt 

### Eurobonds
- Bond issued in a country different from the one in which the currency of the bond is denominated. 
	- ex: a bond issued in Europe but interest is paid in US dollars. 
	- bond needs to be sold in another country different from the one where the bonds currancy is denominated 
- Eurobonds are **NOT** registered with the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) 
- favorable rates of return 
- less rigorous disclosure requriements than those of SEC 
- may **NOT** be offered to US citizens and residents

### Convertable Bonds 
- debt securitites that can be converted to a firm's stock at a prespecified price. 
	- ie. buy bond wiht face value of $1000, maturing in 6 years. in 6 years time you can either take the total pay out of $1000 or since the company offered conversion at $50/stock you could take 20 stocks in the firm. Taking the option would be dependant on the currant price of the firm's stock at the time of the bonds payout. should valueation of stock be greater than $50 you could take the stock option and increase the bond payout (dividends or selling stock outright).

> A Bond is a type of debt or long-term promissory note, issued by the borrower, promising to pay it's holder a predetermined and fixed amount of interest per year and the face value of the bond at maturity    

---

## Types of Bonds: 

### Debentures
- Unsecured long-term debt
- Riskier than secured bonds but have higher interest rate
- No firm assets are put up as collateral, allowing the firm to issue debt and still preserve some ability to borrow in the future 

### Subordinated Debentures
- if firms have more than one outstanding Debentures, they might reorganize it into a hierarchy
	- some Debentures are given a `Subordinated standing in case of insolvency`
	- The claims on this debt are only satisified **AFTER** claims of secured debt and unsubordinated debentures have been satisified. 

### Mortgage Bonds
- Bond secured by lien on real property 
- Usually value of real property is greater than the value of the bond 
- in the case of forclosure: 
	- allows trustee's to sell property and distribute resulting funds to bondholders 
	- bond trustee is usually a banking institution 
	- should sale of property not cover the bonds bondholders become general creditors for the remaining portion of unpaid debt 

### Eurobonds
- Bond issued in a country different from the one in which the currency of the bond is denominated. 
	- ex: a bond issued in Europe but interest is paid in US dollars. 
	- bond needs to be sold in another country different from the one where the bonds currancy is denominated 
- Eurobonds are **NOT** registered with the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) 
- favorable rates of return 
- less rigorous disclosure requriements than those of SEC 
- may **NOT** be offered to US citizens and residents

### Convertable Bonds 
- debt securitites that can be converted to a firm's stock at a prespecified price. 
	- ie. buy bond wiht face value of $1000, maturing in 6 years. in 6 years time you can either take the total pay out of $1000 or since the company offered conversion at $50/stock you could take 20 stocks in the firm. Taking the option would be dependant on the currant price of the firm's stock at the time of the bonds payout. should valueation of stock be greater than $50 you could take the stock option and increase the bond payout (dividends or selling stock outright). 

## Terminology and Characteristics of Bonds

### Claims on assets and income
- in the case of insolvency within the firm: 
	- bonds take priority over that of common stockholders 
- different types of debt can have a hierarchy among themselves 

### Par Value 
- Face value of bond, which is returned to bond holder at time of maturity
- Bonds are generally expressed as a percent of par value (generally 100% == $1,000)

### Coupon interest rate
- percentage of the par value of the bond that will be paid out annually in the form of interest 
- The investor receives a fixed dollar income each yuear from the interst; These bonds are called **Fixed-rate bonds**
- **zero coupon bonds** have a zero or very low coupon rates. Instead of paying interest rates the company sells the bond at a substantial discount below the $1,000 par or face-value. 

### Maturity
- the lenght of time until the bond issuer returns the par value to the bondholder and terminates or redeems the bond. 

### Call Provision
- Bonds may be called or redeemed before their time is up
	- Firms will ususally do this if interest rates start to decline. therefore they can pay off the debts at a lower rate
- Call protection period is a preset amount of time where a company cannot recall a callable bond. 

### Indenture
- legal agreement between firm issuing the bonds and the trustee, who represents the bondholders. 
- The indenture will provide specific terms on the bond, including a description of the bond as well as the rights of the bondholders. The terms are designed to protect the bond from managerial activities that would weaken the bonds standing. 
- Limits placed on bonds typically include: 
	1. Prohibiting the sale of the firms accounts receivables 
	2. limiting common stock dividinds. 
	3. restricting the purchase or sale of the firms fixed assets
	4. Setting limits on additional borrowing by the firm. 

### Bond Ratings
- 3 main rating agencies of bonds 
	1. Moody's 
	2. Standards & Poor's
	3. Fitch Investor Services
- Ratings deal with bond expectations but several factors have historically influence bonds 
	- Greater reliance on equity as opposed to debt in financing the firm. 
	- Profitable operations 
	- low variability in past earnings
	- large firm size
	- little use of subordinated debt 
- Bonds rating will affect it's interest rate. (higher risk bonds carry a higher interest rate, also has higher chance of default on the bond) 
- Junk bonds or High Yield bonds: are those that are rated lower than *BB* by Moody's and Standards & Poor's. These typically have interest rates 3-5% higher than those of AAA rated bonds. 
- Bond Ratings
	- **AAA** highest rating assigned by standard and poors for debt obligations and indicates an extremely strong capacity to pay principal and interest. 
	- **AA** Bonds rated AA also qualify as high quality debt obligations. Their capacity to pay principal and interest is very strong; in the majority of instances, they differ from AAA issues only by a small degree. 
	- **A** Bonds rated A have a strong capacity to pay principal and interest, although they are somewhate more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions
	- **BBB** Bonds rated BBB are regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay principal and interest. whereas they normally exhibit adequate protection parameters, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay principal and interest for bonds in this catagory than for bonds in the A catagory
	- ** BB B CCC CC ** => Bonds rated BB, B, CCC, or CC are regarded, on balance, as predomiinantly speculative with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal in accordance with the terms of obligation. BB indicates the lowest degree of speculation, and CC is the highest. Although such bonds will likely have some quality and protective characteristics, they are outweighted by large uncertainties or major risk exposures to adverse conditions. 
	- ** C** This rating is reserved for bonds that are paying 0 interest. 
	- **D** Bonds rated D are in default; and payment of principal and/or interest is in arrears.

## Defining Value
- Value is defined differently depending on it's context. For us, in finance, value is the present value of future cash flows expected to be received from an investment, discounted at the investor's required rate of return. 
- Book Value: value of an asset as shown on the firms balance sheet. It represents the historical cost of the asset rather than it's current market value. 
- Liquidation value: dollar sum that could be realized if the asset were sold right now, for cash. 
- Market value: The value observed in the marketplace 
- Intrisic or economic value (fair value): The present value of an asset's expected future cash flows. This value is the amount the investor considers to be a fair value given the amount, timing adn riskiness of future cash flows. 
- Efficient market: market in which the value of all securitites fully recognize all available public information. 
- Behavioral finance: the field of study that examines whether investors act rationally or irrationally when making investment descisions

### 3 Major factors in determining value
1. Amount and timing of future cash flows
2. the riskiness of the cash flows
3. the investors attitude towards risk 

### Valuation: The basic process 
- Assigns value to an asset by calculating the present value of its expected future cash flows using the investors required rate of return as the discount rate. Investors required rate *r* is determined by the level fo the risk-free rate of interest and risk premium that the investor feels is necessary compensation. 
- `V = Cn / ( 1 + r)^n`
- where: 
	- `V` = Intrisic value, or present value of an asset producing expected future cashflows (`C`) in years 1 through `n`
	- `C` = Cash flow to be received at time `t`
	- `r` = Investors requried rate of return 
	- `n` = number of years 

### Valuing bonds 
- Present value of bond plus the future interest to be received and the par or maturity value of the bond. 
- Process for valuing a bond, need to know 3 things: 
	- The amount and timing of the cash flows to be received by the investor. 
	- the time to maturity of the bond
	- the investor's required rate of return 
- Calculating bonds value: 
	- **STEP 1** Estimate the amount and timing fo the expected future cash flows. Two types of cash flows are received by the bondholder
		- annual interest payments equal to the coupon rate of interest times the face value of the bond. 
		- the face value to be received at bond maturity
	- **STEP 2** Determine the investor's required rate of return by evaluating the riskiness of the bond's future cash flows. Required rate of return is equal to the rate earned on a risk-free security plus a risk premium for assuming risk. 
	- **STEP 3** Calculate intrinsic value of the bond as the present value of the expected future interest and principal payment discounted at the investor's requried rate of return. 
	- value of bonds Equation: ![equation here](https://buffswtamu-my.sharepoint.com/:i:/g/personal/wrchesley1_buffs_wtamu_edu/EUFYjVx9j0lFodRgApcTl34BkhHIxYG83uc7izumOBtQUg?e=eIR65X "alt text")

### Bond Yields 
- There are two calculations used to measure the rate of return a bondholder receives from owning a bond. 
	- Yield to maturity
	- Current yield 

### Yield to Maturity
- The yield to maturity is the rate of return the investor will earn if the bond is held to maturity, provided, of course, that the company issuing the bond does not default on the payments. (This is equal to the expected rate of return) 
- We compute the yield to maturity by finding the discount rate that equates the present value of the future interest payments and principal payment to the bond's current market price. 

## Current Yield
- The current yield on a bond is the ratio of the annual interest payment of the bond’s current market price. 
- The current yield is not an accurate measure of the bondholder’s expected rate of return from holding the bond to maturity. 

## Bond valuation, Three important relationships 

A. Relationship 1 A decrease in interest rates (required rates of return) will cause the value of a bond to increase; an interest rate increase will cause a decrease in value. The change in value caused by changing interest rates is called interest rate risk. 
B. Relationship 2 1. If the bondholder's required rate of return (current interest rate) equals the coupon interest rate, the bond will sell at par, or maturity value. 2. If the current interest rate exceeds the bond's coupon rate, the bond will sell below par value or at a discount. 3. If the current interest rate is less than the bond's coupon rate, the bond will sell above par value or at a premium. 
C. Relationship 3 A bondholder owning a long-term bond is exposed to greater interest rate risk than an investor owning a short-term bond.

# Chapter 8 Valuation and characteristics of stock
- Preferred Stock
- Valuing Preferred Stock
- Common Stock
- Valuing Common Stock
- Expected Rate of Return of Stockholders

As previously noted, the primary goal of finance managers should be to increase the value of a firms common stock. Thus, we need to understand what determines stocks value. Also, only with an understanding of valutation can we compute a firm's cost of capital, a concept essential to making effective capital investment decisions-an issue to be discussed in chapter 9.

## Preferred Stock
- **Preferred Stock** aka Hybrid Security becuase it has many characteristics of both common stock and bonds. 
	- Similarities to common stock: 
		- no fixed maturity date
		- if the firm fails to pay dividends, nonpayment does not bring on bankrupcy
		- dividends are not tax deductible
	- Similarities to Bonds:
		- Dividends are in fixed amounts
			- The amount is usually a fixed dollar amount or percentage of par value. 
### Characteristics of preferred stock
- **Multiple Series** if a company desires they can issue multiple series of preferred stock. with each series having it's own unique characteristics (ie. series A is convertable whereas Series B is not) 
- **Claims on Assets and Income** Preferred stock has a greater claim on assets in the event of bankrupcy compared to common stock, preferred stockholders claim comes in after the claims of bondholders have been satisified. If there is a series of stock, the company ususally has defined an heirarchy for the series. 
- **Cumulative Dividends** Requirement that all past, unpaid preferred stock dividends to be paid before any common stock dividends are declared. 
- **Protective Provisions** allow for voting rights in the event of nonpayment of dividends, or they restrict the payment of common stock dividends if the preferred stock payments are not met or if the firm is in financial difficulty. 
	- ie. if preferred stock dividends are 6 quarters in arrears the preferred stockholders get voting rights to elect the majority of the board of directors. 
- **Convertibility** aprox 33% of all preferred stock issued is convertable, allowing the stockholder to convert the preferred stock into common stock at a preset rate. ie. 1 preferred stock is equal to 2 common stock. 
- **Retirement Provision** entitles a company to repurchase its preferred stock from holders at stated prices over a given time period. SEC recommends this for all preferred stock.
	- sinking-fund provision: requires the company to set aside funds for the sole purpose of repurchasing preferred stock that is set for retirement. ie. Xerox Corporation has 2 series of preferred stock, one that has a 7 year sinking-fund provision and another that has a 17 year sinking-fund provision. 
	
## Valuing Preferred Stock
- **STEP 1** Estimate the amount and time of the receipt of the future cash flows the preferred stock is expected to provide. 
- **STEP 2** Evaluate the riskiness of the preferred stock's future dividends and determine the investors required rate of return. 
- **STEP 3** Calculate the economic, or intrinsic value of the share of preferred stock, which is the present value of the expected dividends discounted at the investors requried rate of return. 
	- Described as follows
		- Preferred stock value is equal to the divided in year 1 divided by 1 plus the investors requried rate of return. 
		- V<sub>ps</sub> = D / r<sub>ps</sub>
- In summary the value of a preferred stock is the present value of all future dividends. 

## Common Stock 
- **Common Stock** is a certificate that indicates ownership in a corporation. 
- Common stockholders are the true owners of a firm, whereas bondholders and preferred stockholders are more like creditors than owners. 

### Characteristics of Common Stock
- **Claim on Income** as the owners, the common stockholders have the right to the residual income after creditors and preferred stockholders have been paid. This income may be paid directly to the shareholders in the form of dividends or it may be retained for reinvestment within the firm. Both actions will benefit the shareholders. 
- **Claim on Assets** owners also have residual claim on firms assets in case of liquidation. this claim is not usually satisified as creditors and bondholders have first and second claim on the assets. This residual claim on assets increases risk of common stockholders. 
- **Limited Liability** common stockholders have a liability limited to the amount of their investment. 
- **Voting Rights** common stockholders are entitled to elect members of the board of directors, and common stockholders are, in general, the only security holders given a vote. 
	- Usually vote via a **Proxy** or a designated party the given the temporary power of attorny to vote for teh signee at teh corporations annual meeting. Generally the firms management solicits the proxy vote, should financial performance be good, they usually have no trouble soliciting the votes. However if performance has been poor **Proxy fights** have been known to take place, where proxies are battling for proxy votes. 
	- 2 forms of voting 
		- **Majority voting** Each share of stock allows the shareholder one vote and each position on the board of directors is voted on seperatly. 
		- **Cumulative Voting** each share of stock allows the stockholder a number of votes equal to the number of directors being elected. Designed to give minority shareholders greater say in voting on board of directors
- **Preemptive Rights** entitles common stockholder to maintain a proportionate share of ownership in the firm. shoudl the firm issue a new series of stock the current common stock holders have an option on this new series equal to the amount of common stock they currently own. Shoudl I own 25% of a company I am entitled to purchase 25% of the new issuance of stock to maintain my 25% ownership. Else every new issuance of stock would dilute my level of ownership within the firm.

## Valuing Common Stock
- Like bonds and preferred stock, common stock value is equal to the present value of all future cash flows (dividends in this case) expected to be received by the stockholder. *However* Common stock does not have a garunteed dividend like preferred stock does. For common stock the divided is based on profitability of the firm. 	
	- Common Stock value is equal to teh dividend in year 1 divided by the required rate of return minus the growth rate of the company. 
	- V<sub>cs</sub> = D<sub>1</sub> / r<sub>cs</sub> - g
		- where g = ROE x pr 
		- ROE = Return on equity (net income divided by common book value) 
		- pr = company's percentage of profits retainted, called *profit-retention rate* 
			- retention rate is equal to ( 1 minus the percentage of profits paid out in dividends) 

## The Expected Rate of Return of Stockholders
- The rate of return the investor can expect to earn from the investment if it is bought at the current market price. 
	- Expected rate of return is equal to the annual divided divided by the preferred stock market price 
	- r<sub>ps</sub> = D / P<sub>ps</sub>
	- r<sub>ps</sub> = D / P<sub>ps</sub>


# Cost of Capital
- The return a company needs in order to take on a capital project, such as purchasing new equipment or constructing a new building. 
	- usually comprised of both equity and debt 
	- returns should exceed costs of financing the project else investors will not see a return. 
	
- Early stage companies will typically choose equity financing because they typically lack the assets to put forth as collateral for debt financing. Less-established companies will pay a higher interest rate on financing because of a lack of financial history; investors will demand a higher risk-premium. 
- The cost of debt is merely the interest rate paid by the company on its debt. However, since interest expense is tax-deductible, the debt is calculated on an after-tax basis as follows:
	- Cost of Debt equals interest expense divided by Total Debt, then multiplied by 1 minus the company's marginal tax rate
	- Cost of Debt =  Interest Expense / Total Debt \* (1 - T)
	- Where: 
		- Interest expense = Int. Paid on the firms current debt
		- T = The company's marginal tax rate

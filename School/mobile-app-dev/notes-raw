Proff babb stayed away from create-react-app to reduce degrees of freedom in creating react apps. 
without create-react-app is that it doesn't scale very well. 
Create-React-App will: 
    build
    test
    lint
    run in dev-env
NPM and Webpack pull all this together. Javascript nerdery lol (always new tools and other ways of doing 'x')
caveat of no create-react-app: hard to scale with 3rd party services; (ie. implementing firebase)

get in habit of creating components that talk to their parent, makes talking to 3rd party services easier. 

[PERSONAL NOTE: Inner exception handling, per say you have nested method calls, ie. MethodA calls MEthodB
calls MethoC...etc... can pass exception from one level to another, just keep throwing it up until you hit UI level
where you can then handle the exception]

Possible CI/CD cloud solution in React native?

React Native Tooling, 
    Book CH13. 10,11,12 are reiterations of stuff already seen in pizzabandit
Created expo.io account, online tool to build/emulate IOS/Android devices. has IOS/Android App to emulate my code on (have to be on same local network.)
`npm install -g expo-cli` to install expo-cli tools ref docs here: https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/ 

Create-react-native (CLI) method: 
`react-native init Your-App-Name`

Changeing import statement in react-pizza/src/firebase/db yeilds this: 
Firebase: No Firebase App '[DEFAULT]' has been created - call Firebase App.initializeApp() (app/no-app).

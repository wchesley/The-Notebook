Proff babb stayed away from create-react-app to reduce degrees of freedom in creating react apps. 
without create-react-app is that it doesn't scale very well. 
Create-React-App will: 
    build
    test
    lint
    run in dev-env
NPM and Webpack pull all this together. Javascript nerdery lol (always new tools and other ways of doing 'x')
caveat of no create-react-app: hard to scale with 3rd party services; (ie. implementing firebase)

get in habit of creating components that talk to their parent, makes talking to 3rd party services easier. 

[PERSONAL NOTE: Inner exception handling, per say you have nested method calls, ie. MethodA calls MEthodB
calls MethoC...etc... can pass exception from one level to another, just keep throwing it up until you hit UI level
where you can then handle the exception]

Possible CI/CD cloud solution in React native?

React Native Tooling, 
    Book CH13. 10,11,12 are reiterations of stuff already seen in pizzabandit
Created expo.io account, online tool to build/emulate IOS/Android devices. has IOS/Android App to emulate my code on (have to be on same local network.)
`npm install -g expo-cli` to install expo-cli tools ref docs here: https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/ 

Create-react-native (CLI) method: 
`react-native init Your-App-Name`

Changeing import statement in react-pizza/src/firebase/db yeilds this: 
Firebase: No Firebase App '[DEFAULT]' has been created - call Firebase App.initializeApp() (app/no-app).

preclass: 
Mobile app wirefram in draw.io
ref: https://lineupr.com/event-app-demos/pyconde/ for example apps 
    how to dispaly map? feel like world map is too much for this? could superimpose what data we need on a static image?
    - map the image bits, what's important to what location, this method is not scalable as it would require a rework
        of this image for each new venue / minor change in anything to do with location. but this method could be more precise.

InClass: 
-Planning for Project. 
    like for me and partner to have design docs for this. wireframe, mock up, story board. 
    story board plug in? in visual studio? (not code...) could be done in powerpoint? seems meh, just stitch up UI components in draw.io. 

Fetch => promise --> api to DarkSKy weather API;

Final Project: Academic Conference App

ISCAP is a professional association of Information Systems Educators and holds a conference every year.  For this conference, it would be helpful if they had a mobile app such that they might better coordinate during the conference.

The conference organizers need a simple app to implement the following features:

Push Notifications
Speaker/Presenter Bios
A list of sessions (a schedule of events)
Upload photos
Maps of the location
Events and the ability to search/filter events
Social Media
FAQs
Lost and Found
Features and Storyboards

It would be best, for planning purposes to first to further describe and document the above features by creating for each:

A name/title
A description
Storyboards/Wireframes (follow the style that Wilken uses)

 _Virtual Teams: Mastering Communication adn Collaboration in the Digital age_ 

 While people do like the freedom to choose how to accomplish a task, very few people thrive on the freedom to chose what they should be doing. 

 ### Motivation Theories

 1. _satisfied_ vs _dissatisfied_
    - Employees will only be satisfied if the work itself is challenging and they can achieve recognition and advancement. 
    - Does not consider the fact that dissatisfaction could come from work environment
        * relationship with supervisor
        * working conditions
        * company policies
        * interpersonal relationships
        * even company benefits 
    - Even if all environment variables are met, boring dead-end work will not lead to satisfied employees. 
    - The work environment has extra variables in a virtual setting
        * frustrations with technology
        * Poor communication

2. _Needs fulfillment_
    - Idea that people apply extra effort only when it can fulfill a psychological need that they have, but while each person may be driven in part by many needs, individuals may be stronger or weaker in any one given area: 
        * The need for _achievement_
        * The need for _power_
        * The need for _affiliation_ 
    - Ex: someone may love the feeling of accomplishment that comes from solving a problem (achievement). Another may thrive on the ability to organize and influence others (power) and lastly, one might be driven to maintain close connections with teammates adn colleagues (affiliation).
    - note there's a need for _autonomy_ as well as the other 3 listed here. _Autonomy_ is a basic need shared by everyone, essentially: Nobody seems to like being watched adn controlled every step of the way. 
    - For virtual teams, Autonomy is a double edged sword, too much freedom and people tend to 'drift' away from the task at hand. A well defined schedule is a good solution to this problem. 

3. _Expectancy_ Theory
    - Perceived link between efforts and outcomes
        * Effort -> Performance -> Reward
    - People need to believe that if they put in their effort, then they will attain a certain level of performance and if that level is achieved then they will be rewarded in a certain way. Sounds obvious but this chain is often broken in organizations. 
    - People need to believe they have the power to attain a goal. If they do not think the set goal is attainable, motivation will fall to 0. Goals need to be SMART
        S. Specific
        M. Measurable
        A. Attainable
        R. Relevant
        T. Timebound
    - People need to believe that if a certain level of performance is attained, then a reliable reward will follow. **If a promised reward fails to happen it can have disastrous effects across the whole team.** 
    - TIP: make sure that employees know ahead of time exactly what rewards will be **based** on and rewards must be based on things that actually need to be accomplished. **EXPECTATIONS CAN AND WILL INFLUENCE OUTCOMES**

### Notes: 

Effective praise can be a great motivation, scientifically proven to improve results. Praise needs to be administered correctly however. ie. _fixed_ vs. _growth_ mind set. 
    - in an experiment, kids were given a complicated set of tasks to complete, those that completed more than half received praise. Of those worthy of praise, half were told it was because they were so smart, the other half was told the achievement was on account of the hard work (effort) they put forth. when asked to complete a second set of tasks the kids who were told they did it because they were smart were **less motivated** to complete the second set than those who were praised based on effort. THEORY BEHIND: If your mindset is fixed, ou feel that your capabilities are relatively set, and all performance feedback reflects on those capabilities. vs. If your mindset is oriented towards growth, you are always seeking to improve and change your current capabilities. 

`Praise the effort, not the result. State the value of learning and meeting challenges as apposed to impressive outcomes`

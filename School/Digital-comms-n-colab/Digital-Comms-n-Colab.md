### 2/12 Context Communication

framework from which we connect the dots so everything makes sense

Team members working in close proximity can quickly assess others cues and therefore understand the context. 

On-site maria: you can see she's busy, you know her more personally, plus you've worked day to day with her for 5 years so you are aware of her work schedule. 
Off-site Maria: WHile both have been with company for 5 years, they've never met face to face, there's no *context* from which to derrive Maria's work habits or methods for getting things done. you have no idea whet here day to day schedule would look like and therefore no way of knowing why she responded to the important email so late in the day. Distinct lack of background information. 

* Enviromental Cues
* Medium Cues
* Relationship Cues

## Enviromental Cues:

* Physical condidition of workspace
* Visual and Audio Cues
* Cues diminish with distance -> diminished cues

Enviromental cues in class: 
    minor amount increased effort for communicating virtually - more formal, explicit language/tone
    Smaller class size
    Class room number (CC205) => tells us where class is
    CIDM 3320 what the class is, who's teaching it, what grade level is class geared towards. 

Environmental Challenges
    Team members awareness of tasks and availability
        use group discussions and shared documents
        Share metting calendars...

#### ID lost riders: 
*    Often pushes back deadlines
*    Time lag in response to emails & Phone calls. 
*    Does not contribute to work product. 
*    Stop responding to requests. 

possible teammember didn't see our e-messages or has other deadlines, if you have concerns or other projects going on, you need to let your teamembers know because they don't share your *context* 

#### Strats: 
*    Set short term goals
*   Talk with other team members sooner rather than later. 
*    Develop availability and haev a clear performance plan. 

#### ENVIROMENTAL CONTD...

Value of multitasking: 
    very prevelant in multitasking and hard to addrdess. 
Could write team code to mitigate this
more constant check-ins

Multitasking good or bad?
could be both? explicityly going to do 2 things at once (first example vid) shows a written story and spoken one, each is different and you have to pay attention to both. But what about driving? can listen to audio book and drive at same time. 

## Medium: 

Second type of context comms. 
* Richness of information [is different from email vs. spoken word]

Format: 
    Written comms
    Voice
    Video

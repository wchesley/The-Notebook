# Chapter 9: Reaching Global Markets

## Political, Legal and Regulatory Forces  
- A Countries legal and regulatory infrastructure is a direct reflection of its political climate. Varries depending on government type (democracy vs. theocracy vs. totalitarianism)
	- State-backed firms (ie. China) make up 1/3 of emerging foreign direct investments made in the last decade.  
- Laws can act as barriers of trade: ie. The EU has more strict anti-trust laws than does the US, making it more difficult for larger US companies to operate in the EU (intel has been fined for this) 	
### Top Countries to start a business: 
| Rank | Country | 
|---|---|
| 1 | United Kingdom |
| 2 | New Zeland |
| 3 | Netherlands |
| 4 | Sweden |
| 5 | Canada |
| 6 | Hong Kong |
| 7 | Denmark |
| 8 | Ireland |
| 9 | Singapore |
| 10 | Switzerland |

- ** Import Tarrif: ** any duty levied on goods bought outside its borders and brought into the country. 
	- Tarrifs may impeed free trade between nations
	- usually used to protect domestic goods or raise revenue for host country 
- ** Quota: ** Limit on the amount of goods an importing country will accept for certain product catagores in a specific period of time. 
- ** Embargo: ** Government's suspension of trade in a particular product or with a given country. 
	- Embargoes are generally directed at specific goods or countries and are established for political, health, or religious reasons. (Think oil rations of 1970's) 
- ** Exchange Controls: ** Government restrictions on the amount of a particular currency that can be bought or sold. 
	- Developing economies use exchange control to limit speculation against their currencies and to limit foreign investment. 
- ** Balance of Trade: ** difference between a countries imports and exports
	- A negative balance of trade is considered harmful because it means U.S. dollars are supporting foreign economies at the expense of U.S. companies and workers. At the same time, U.S. citizens benefit from the assortment of imported products and their typically lower prices. As with everything, there is a trade off somewhere. 

## Ethical and Social Responsibility Forces
- Some countries still facilitate the use of payoffs and bribes to conduct business, however the UK bribery act and the US foreign corrupt practices act prevent any firm from the US or UK from participating in bribes in any way; direct or indirect. 
- differing ethical standards affect marketing efforts. ie. china's standards regarding intelectual propert (IP) differ dramatically from those in the United States, creating potential conflicts for marketers of computer software, music, and books. Trade in counterfeit goods has been estimated to be anywhere from $200 billion to more than $1.7 trillion worldwide, but the full scope is unknown according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

- Doing business in foregin contries exposes US firms to new cultures and styles of business, particularly shocking for those less traveled 
	- ** self-reference criterion (SRC) ** the unconscious reference to one’s own cultural values, experiences, and knowledge. When confronted with a situation, we react on the basis of knowledge we have accumulated over a lifetime, which is usually grounded in our culture of origin. Our reactions are based on meanings, values, and symbols that relate to our culture but may not have the same relevance to people of other cultures.
- Naturally businesses want to adapt to local cultures and do business the way that they do. However this can lead to Cultural relativism
	- ** Cultural relativism: **the concept that morality varies from one culture to another and that business practices are, therefore, differentially defined as right or wrong by particular cultures.
- Some major international firms support the ** Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) ** which racks emerging issues and trends, provides information on corporate leadership and best practices, conducts educational workshops and training, and assists organizations in developing practical business ethics tools.

## Competitive Forces 
- Competition is a staple in the market place; customers thrive on it; firms are bettered by it (only the strongest will survive) 
- Each country has unique competitive aspects (natural traits that make them better or worse in the international marketplace) 
	- Although competitors drive competition, nations establish the infrastructure and the rules for the types of competition that can take place. For example, the privacy laws in the European Union are stricter than those in the United States.
- should an internationally available product offer more features or better quality local customers will soon demand that their local markets offer the same product at the same or lower price.

## Chapter 1
 good morning welcome to principles of marketing
We are going to jump right
into chapter one this morning and start
off by just defining the term marketing
what is marketing? what is it we're going
to be talking about this terms. So the
American Marketing Association defines
marketing as all of the steps in the
process that take a product to, uh
to the customer. So there you're talking
about how you distribute the product how
you define what the product will be.
How you promote the product.
How you communicate to your, to your customer and
finally how you place the product.
I will say to that marketing as much is as much
of philosophy as it is a process to.
So, um, we'll talk more about this but the
marketing concept puts the customer at
the center of the marketing process so
it's really all about the customer.
What's important to that customer.
And you really have to know who your customer is
in order to effectively market a product
to that customer. So the group of
customers that you are particularly
interested in selling or marketing a
product to those people are considered
your target market
alright so once you figure out who
you're selling your product you were or
who you are intending a particular
product offering to be four then you can
get pretty strategic about how you bring
that product to market and we call the
combination of product price promotion
and a place or your book will call it
distribution we call that the four Ps
so distribution of course does not fit
in at all but a place to us so we'll use that instead
So anyway the combination of those four
variables can be extremely strategic and
we'll definitely talk more about that this term
let's talk a little bit in particular
about the things that will make you
more successful in a marketing effort.
What are the critical factors?
Ok so first of all it truly is about
relationships. The relationship you have
with your customers the relationship you
have with your partners in the process
your suppliers your retail stores,
newspapers, political affiliations
relationships are huge and how you
manage those relationships is is very
huge. You'll see in your in your textbook
there's a conversation about customer
relationship management and this has to
do with collecting information on the
people that are important to you.
Your customers or vendors your suppliers your
retail partners and so you need to know
what's important to those people you
need to know a lot about them. And so to
the extent that you can collect that
information and tap into it with your
marketing strategy you'll be more successful.
ok so the second point I'd like to talk
to has to do with the marketing
environment. So you are operating in
a marketing playing field that is a
moving target and so some of the
variables that will be happening have to
do with your competition, technology,
sociocultural implications of where
your marketing–let's see–Political
environment, legal and regulatory factors
that you have to deal with, and economic
factors–how much money do people have to
spend on your product with their wealth.
With their buying power. So we'll talk
more about that. All of those things.
Create a moving target for you and so if
to the extent that you're able to keep
your finger on the pulse of all of those
elements that you'll be more successful
in marketing your product.
The marketing concept has to do with really
understanding who your customer is and
what they want
so what do you need to do
to create customer satisfaction
really that's the bottom line with the
marketing concept. And finally technology
is huge when it comes to marketing you
know we all know that technology has
changed so much in the last decade not
to mention the last fifty hundred years
and it's it's continuing to evolve and
so as a marketer you need to be up to
speed with with the technology that your
customers are using. And if you fall
behind you're not going to be as
successful. So just imagine if you did
not for example have a website where you
could promote your product online that's
that's almost an obvious expectation in
the world today you have to you have to
be up to speed with technology.
So these four things are going to impact your
success in the marketing arena. How well
you maintain your relationships and tap
into that information. How well you keep
track of what's going on in the
marketing environment. How good you do at
providing customer satisfaction.
Keeping your customer in the middle of
everything you do and finally how well
you do at keeping up with technology.
Alright so why do we even care?
Why is marketing even important?
well it is hugely important. I don't even
know where to begin with this.
Marketing creates a standard of living.
Because we have marketing in our country, in the
United States for example, we can go to
stores and find products that we like
and need. If we didn't have marketing
those products wouldn't be available to
us and our standard of living would be
very different. Extend that to a
global level. Marketing becomes
hugely important in politics in
cross-cultural interactions around the
world it's it's just a huge element in
in the global economy. Why? Because it
creates value for customers because it gives
customers a quality of life that they
desire and products that they enjoy in
their life. So speaking just a little bit
more to value that's a pretty subjective
thing and so what valuable are important
to one customer is not the same as
what's valuable to another customer.
And again getting back to understanding who
your customer is and all of the
different elements in a particular
marketing arena. What sociocultural
elements, technology elements,
economic buying power elements. All of those
things factor into what's going to make
something of value or mean that your
product is a value or not a value to
your to your target market.
Alright so the bottom line here is that
marketing brings a state of value and
well-being to customers and stakeholders.
And so you'll see this in your textbook–
but a stakeholder is not just a customer
but everybody that comes into contact
with your company or that cares about
What you're doing with your products.
So customers certainly but also employers
–er, sorry– I mean employees, your people in
your supply chain: so vendors, your retail
stores, it could even be advocacy groups,
or people that care about how your
product is impacting the environment.
All of those different players are stakeholders.
And so what you do as a company
and how you market impact their
sense of well-being. And so it becomes
very important to people–just–however
you're going about your marketing will
be important in the world
alright I'm going to button up this
chapter with just a little laundry list
here of concepts that I like so you to have
Most of these we've talked about
we've talked about: Target Market,
Marketing Mix, Value. We've talked about
stakeholders in the marketing concept.
I'll just mention a couple of these that
we haven't spoken specifically to.
So an exchange has to do with understanding
what one party is willing to give up or sacrifice,
in order to obtain something in return
so that's an exchange. We think about
paying a certain amount of money to buy
a product but exchange can also be your time.
You could be giving up a certain amount of time
to get something in return. Or an inconvenience could also be
part of an exchange. So take a look at
that in the chapter. And also the concept
of customer relationship management has
to do with creating systems that track
and collect and leverage information about customers
in strategic marketing processes. So we'll read more
about that as well. And green marketing–finally–
has to do with leveraging in your
marketing campaigns the concept
that you are being good to the environment and this is huge anymore
again there are many stakeholders that
care a lot about how the the environment
is being impacted. And so you'll see a
lot of marketing professionals taking
great strides to or going to great lengths
to make their product appear green and their company appear
environmentally friendly.
So those are those a pretty good
representation of the key factors in chapter one
and do let me know if you have any questions.
I'll be happy to speak with you in more depth
about any of this material
ok–alright–thank you–have a good day

## Chapter 2
 Good morning. We're going to be talking
today about chapter 2 which is all about
marketing strategy. And so when I think
about marketing strategy I think about
it being sort of a game. So let's
imagine that marketing strategy is as
something like the game of Risk.
Are you familiar with that game?
It's a board game where you collect armies and
you attack different countries and try
to conquer the whole world and so we do
something like that in in marketing we
have our kingdoms and we have our armies
and we have our battlefields and we
are trying to conquer the world in a
sense or at least our little corner of
it. And so we can approach marketing
strategy something like you might
approach going to war in the game of
Risk so if you're going to prepare for a
war you would need to–at least for the game of Risk;
hopefully it's just a game–you would
need to have an idea where in the world
you think you should attack and where
you might have a good chance of winning
a battle and you get your armies ready
and you have a game plan your rally your
troops and then you march out into the
battlefield and begin your conquest.
So we do the same sort of thing with
with marketing. And so in marketing we
start with a mission statement.
It's pretty important to to lay the
groundwork for who you are as a company
and where you want to be with your
company in the world. And so a mission
statement and does that for you.
So for example Starbucks mission
statement is "to inspire and nurture..."
I'm not going to remember... "to inspire and
nurture the human spirit one cup in one
community at a time." So they're trying to
conquer the coffee world right?
And buried in that that mission statement is
some sense of who their target customer is
and what their core competency is a company.
So they are all about coffee and they're
looking to bring their coffee to all
coffee drinkers and coffee communities
in the world.
So, it sounds simple but getting your arms
around that who you are and where you
want to go with your company is hugely
important and it really does lay the
groundwork for your marketing strategy.
So that sort of thinking and planning
happens at a top level in a
company. Really at the corporate
level of strategic planning it's all
about setting the vision; the mission and
being able to allocate your resources
from a corporate level to the different
sorts of marketing avenues or
battlefields that you intend to go after.
So that's what we mean when we are
talking about corporate marketing
strategies one of the things you'll do
at the corporate level is to organize
your your company or your armies–if you
want to think about it like that. So you
have, in a business you have what are
called strategic business units or you
can think of these as profit centers.
So you may choose to organize your company
by different product categories or maybe
by geographic locations north america vs
Europe for example. And so you're
collecting your your profits your sales
for each of those different business units
and you're also organizing your
marketing efforts by those business units
and so ultimately what will happen
is that each of your business units will
have its own sorts of strategies.
So in order to, in order to be
able to direct those business units into
battle you need to know something about
where they're going or where there's
opportunity for them to win the battle.
So in order to in order to do a good job in
directing your business units you need
to do a good job with your marketing analysis
and so that you are clear about
what what the opportunities in the market are.
You may find it in one
particular marketing avenue or playing
field you have a strategic window of
opportunity to do something quickly.
You need to know that that window is there
and that you want to be able to capture
that opportunity so again your
ability to direct your troops from a
marketing perspective has a lot to do
with understanding the market opportunities
that exist in different areas.
Per different strategic
business units, if you will. And you need
to be able to allocate your resources as
a company in a thoughtful way to give
each of your strategic business units (SBUs)
the resources that they need to
march out into the battlefield.
Ultimately what will happen
it's a little bit of an iterative process
You need to understand your
market, so there's market analysis that
happens, and there's a an evaluation of
what the potential target markets are
what the windows of opportunity are in a
marketplace it may depend on what
competitive factors are going on there
socio-cultural factors and some of the
other things that we discussed last in
chapter one is just an introduction.
So there are these things happening in the
market that are external to your company
and sometimes there are opportunities
and sometimes there are threats that you
as a company need to be prepared for or
willing and able to act upon and but as
a company you will also have your strong
suits and your weaknesses and so you
need to be real clear about who you are
and what you're capable of doing.
And this goes back to the idea of being able
to allocate your resources. So there may
be a great opportunity in the market but
if you don't have the funding or the presence in a market
or the human resources to go after it–that's
not a good fit for you to go after that particular opportunity
In analyzing your market you will end up with a–you should,
hopefully–we'll end up with a clear idea
of what your opportunities are, what
threats exist in the marketplace but you also need to be real clear
about what your strengths and weaknesses are
as a company and so the combination of
all of that is called a SWOT analysis:
Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats.
And really you have to have all
of that before you can be real clear
about where you want to go.
What battlefield you want to pursue.
Once you have a good handle on your
strengths and weaknesses as a company,
what the opportunities and threats are
in the marketplace that you're
working within, then you're in a
position to think about how you can
allocate your resources as a company and
what exactly you want to be able to do
with those resources. So this is where
you're developing marketing objectives
which are more detailed plans around
what you actually intend to do.
When you are clear about what you you're able to
do is the company in your market then
you can be strategic about identifying
who your customers are going to be that
you're going to target and what your
marketing mix will be that you're going to use
To pursue that market.
what's the marketing mix? Product, Place, Promotion, and Price.
So again that goes back to chapter one.
Alright so. If you are the king in your country
or the president of your company
it's your job to take the lead to
organize and rally your troops to go
into battle. And so you set the tone
which has a lot to do with setting
creating a corporate culture–will talk
more about that in future weeks–but you
really are setting the tone for rallying
your troops. And so there's an awful lot
of planning that goes into executing a
marketing strategy and in order
to do it well you you're going to have to be organized;
you're going to have to be able to communicate and motivate your
people and you're going to have to be
able to set some setup some
accountability–which has to do with
planning for the timing of when certain
things are going to be able to happen
and holding people accountable to those action items.
And then finally the chapter goes into some discussion
of figuring out how well you did.
How well did you do on the battlefield?
Where you able to successfully infiltrate this country
and conquer that territory?
Ok so how do you know if you've done that from a
marketing perspective? The two major ways that
people look at–to get their arms around
that–are to look at either sales or profit.
Ok so, what were your sa...of course when we're marketing we're selling product...
So what happened with your sales
of a particular product in a particular market?
You need to be able to set some goals
for what you want your sales or
expect your sales will be. And then you
need to be able to track your actual
performance against those standards.
Ok so, you can look at your
your sales performance but you can also
look at your profit performance.
And in order to look at your profit performance
you have to be able to get your arms
around your costs which sounds simple
but it can be very difficult. So those
are the two major ways that you'll
evaluate the successfulness of your
marketing strategy or your marketing battle. Ok.
Alright so, all of these things. All of these things
that we've we've been
talking about a marketing department or
a company will roll into a marketing
plan and so really the marketing plan
just documents what your strategy is
going to be. What your your mission is a
company and how you're going to march out to to succeed
in accomplishing that mission. Ok.
So these are the sections of the marketing plan
and you'll get familiar with these
as you work on your term project to
create a marketing plan and I'm not
going to really go into depth with those
at this point but these are the
elements that that would roll into a marketing plan.
Alright so, for chapter 2 we've covered quite a lot and these are
the... this is a list of the things I would
hope that you would have learned from
Chapter 2. Most of these things we've
talked about but i'll touch on a few.
Corporate identity has to do with
developing your brand as a company and
so what you would like is for, if people
mention your name, that customers
will have an idea of who you are.
So if we if we say Alexander the Great,
for example, we have a real clear idea of who that guy was.
Or Attila the hun for example.
So companies are pretty strategic and
intentional about developing a brand
developing a symbol that people were
recognized and everything you do to
develop that brand rolls into who you
are as a company and what people think
of when they hear your company name–
what your company identity is. Ok.
So as far as moving into a territory
you may be able to recognize a
first-mover advantage which is the case
when you are able to secure competitive
advantage by being first to the market.
That sometimes, being first to the market
gives you the prominence in that
industry or the name that makes you successful.
If you don't do it well though
you can make a lot of mistakes
and in a case like that other companies
we may come in behind you and they may
recognize a late movie advantage by not
making the mistakes that you made and in
that case they can actually secure competitive advantage
where you were not able to.
Ok. So let's see
As far as centralized versus decentralized organization.
Again, as the as the king of your company
you have to decide how to
organize your business units and what
kind of authority are you going to give people
in your company. Are you going to
control everything from the top of the company?
Are you going to delegate authority down through
the chain of command in your company?
So that is centralized versus decentralized organization.
And I think we talked about the rest of that.
So, I hope that you are as excited about marketing strategy as I am.
I love it.
I love thinking about it like a game,
Anyway that wraps up chapter 2. Thanks, have a good week. 

---
## Chapter 4
 all right so today we're going to be
talking about chapter 4 which is about
social responsibility and ethics in
marketing and so I'd like to hone in on
these topic areas by really digging into
the difference between the two okay so
in a nutshell to be an ethical marketer
it means that you are complying with or
adhering to some acceptable marketing
practices or behaviors and and so that
sounds may be very simple but these can
be pretty murky waters so for example
let's say that you are a product manager
for mac cosmetics which is a popular
trendy line of cosmetics according to my
daughters and let's say that you are a
product manager for mac cosmetics and
you're looking to find some new target
audiences to expand your product
category sales so maybe you decide that
you would like to start marketing your
cosmetics to a younger age group 13 year
old girls so would you be ok with that
keeping in mind that your advertisement
and promotion activities for this
company in general tend to be pretty
racy pretty sexually explicit maybe
you're not OK marketing your products to
13 year old girls maybe you are so how
about 8 year old girls would that be
okay and if we want to take you an even
more controversial controversial example
how about if you are marketing tobacco
or alcohol products would you be okay
promoting those products to pregnant
women for example so the point here is
that you you will have opportunities to
make these kind of question mark
decisions within marketing and how you
make them is it will determine whether
or not you're behaving ethically or
socially responsibly all right so I want
to make the point that these sorts of
dilemmas can impact any of the four PS
how you price your product could be
ethical the sorts of products that you
create could be unethical how you
promote them could be unethical when and
how and where you distribute them it
could be a problem
so any of the four-piece could be
involved
anytime that you have a decision to make
that could be right or wrong or have
more than one potential choice you have
yourself an ethical issue to contend
with and how you resolve those issues or
those question marks will depend on
three different things in general your
own background so individual factors how
your company decides how things normally
should be done so your company culture
is important and and third what sorts of
opportunities are even an option for you
and your role in your company in your
business capacity to make different
sorts of decisions so we're going to
talk about all three of these so first
of all your background has a huge role
to play and how you make your ethical
decisions in business what are your
values what are you comfortable doing
personally I don't think I have to say
much more about that it's just your own
background and that definitely will play
in secondly what's the culture in your
company if people are promoted by
behaving an uncaught in questionable
manner if they get an annual bonus
because they were able to sell product
in in a way that you would consider to
be maybe not necessarily right you're
going to have a lot more of that sort of
behavior happening so the culture that
is created for a company has a lot of
bearing on how ethical issues are
resolved and finally is there
opportunity in a company to to be
unethical a huge trend in business these
days is for companies to actually lay
out and define a code of conduct which
outlines exactly what is and isn't
acceptable behavior in a company and so
that may address how you conduct
yourself on the Internet
how you dress what time you come to work
how you interact with customers can you
accept gifts if yes what value of gifts
can you accept all of those individual
little
little elements of how you behave at
work can be addressed in a code of
conduct and and actually can give a lot
of important guidance to employees
we have a code of conduct as marketers
that has been defined by the American
Marketing Association and so I've kind
of put them in a nutshell here but just
looking over the norms and values for
what we as marketers aspire to you can
kind of get a sense of of what we
consider right and wrong so we want
people to trust marketing as a
profession we do not want to create
anything that's harmful to people we
respect and value transparency honesty
our reputation fairness concern for the
customer the AMA Code of Ethics really
does guide our behavior and what is what
is considered acceptable practice for
marketers and people in the marketing
profession
alright so in our textbook there's a
concept presented called the pyramid of
corporate social responsibility and I'm
going to speak to these different levels
briefly first of all at the very base of
the pyramid is an economic layer and
really any company that exists desires
to be profitable so the first
responsibility for a company is that
they need to be able to generate a
profit from their business or else they
won't be in business
so all companies have this sort of an
economic concern going up the the
pyramid here the next layer is a legal
layer so as marketing professionals or
people running a company we agree to
comply with the laws of the land and so
if you are obeying the laws then you are
adhering to the legal element of this
pyramid the next layer up is the ethical
layer here or stage I guess of
development you could say and the things
we've been talking about adhering to the
AMA Marketing code of conduct for
example or adhering to the corporate
culture that exists for you and your
company those would be considered being
compliant at an ethical level are you
trying to do right and your in your
behavior ok so moving up the ladder to
the philanthropic level here's where you
really start to see a social
responsibility come into play alright so
if you are a socially responsible person
in business then you are really being a
good citizen or trying to endeavoring to
be a good citizen and there are three
ways that you exercise social
responsibility that are discussed in our
in our textbook number one
sustainability so this is where you are
demonstrating a concern for the invite
creating products that are
environmentally friendly trying to
eliminate waste out of your business
processes
maybe designing packaging that doesn't
have a lot of plastic or things in there
that can't be recycled
that sort of thing number two concern
exercising a concern or demonstrating
concern for the consumer rights consumer
rights that are generally agreed upon
are the right to be safe or the right to
safety the right to be heard the right
to be informed and finally the right to
choose so if you can keep those tenants
in mind as you go about your marketing
life then you are exercising consumerism
and there's a lot of interest right now
in protecting consumer rights
so I'm imagine you'll likely bump into
that and finally exercising or
demonstrating concern for your community
so are you behaving in a way that is not
going to cause any sort of a negative
impact or harm to your community if you
are complying with all of those three
levels then you can say that you are a
philanthropic sort of a business
enterprise operating at this good
citizen level of the pyramid which is at
the top of the pyramid and and you would
you would be a socially responsible
business person why does it matter that
we'd be a socially responsible sort of a
business person well aside from just
doing the right thing and feeling good
about what you do at work every day it
can be pretty profitable to be socially
responsible these days customers want to
do business with companies that care
about them care about the environment
care about their community and it can
translate into into dollars to your
bottom line so either do either be
socially responsible or find ways to be
a good citizen because it feels good or
because it can be profitable so so
that's really the message for Chapter
four
things that I'd like you to know from
this chapter know what a stakeholder
orientation is this basically means
understand who what the players are that
are impacted by your your activities in
business whether they be the media
advocacy groups customers employees keep
all of those players in mind know what
cause related marketing is and I guess I
want to speak to supply chain management
if you are a manufacturer of products
and you have a lot of players in your in
your processes so say coca-cola has to
source sugar and different ingredients
for soda into their manufacturing
process and then they have to have
somebody brew the the soda and bottle of
soda and market the soda and transport
the soda all of those different players
in their supply chain are really
interested in keeping coca-cola happy
coca-cola has a lot of power in that
relationship and so you can find a lot
of opportunities for ethical issues to
come up in supply chain management so
I'm just throwing that out there to get
you thinking about that you may not be a
coca-cola in your professional life but
you will have relationships with a lot
of different players and you could
choose to exercise an element of power
in those relationships or you could be
careful to always be fair handed in your
business dealings and so you will you
will run into that just want to bring it
up the corporate culture that you create
you may be directly involved in creating
that culture and so to the extent that
you just know that your your role in
creating a corporate culture will impact
how your people behave and how they
conduct themselves in business and so
it's important I guess that's it for
chapter 4 let me know if you have any
questions and I hope you all have a good
rest of your week

## Chapter 3
 good afternoon today we're gonna be
talking about chapter three which is
titled the marketing environment and and
I'm going to today call this monitoring
the winds of change okay so here in the
Texas Panhandle we all know what it's
like to go out on a windy day and put
your face into the wind and maybe you
see storm clouds in the in on the
horizon or maybe you can just get a good
whiff of hereford but you get a lot of
information by putting your face into
the wind so it's kind of like that with
monitoring the marketing environment
it's important to keep an eye on the
horizon to know what's coming your way
and and the reason that's important is
because there's opportunity out there
and there's also danger and so we do
need to both scan the environment which
is to collect information about what's
going on out there and also to analyze
that information so marketing analysis
so we're going to be discussing six
different elements of the marketing
environment that are particularly
important to marketers and if you look
at this list here notice that all of
these elements are external to a
particular company or anything the
company does so to that point they tend
to be fairly uncontrollable yet still
important as we'll see for us to keep
our eye on okay so competitive economic
political legal and regulatory
technological and socio-cultural
so we're going to speak first about
competitive forces and so this is huge
who are your competitors in your
marketplace there are different
categories of competitors that you'll
see in the chapter brand competitors are
products that are very similar to yours
with the same features product
competitors are in the same product
category but not as similar they have
different features
generic competitors are solving the same
sort of a problem for customers but
they're quite different from yours and
then generic competitors are sorry total
budget competitors are competitive
products that are just competing for the
same spending dollar okay so we care
about these because consumers have a
limited amount of money to spend on
products and so we would like them to
think our product is the best one out
there for them to choose we have to care
about our competitors because they're
who we're going to battle with right so
consumers have a certain amount of money
to spend and and we would like them to
spend money on our product over somebody
else's and so to that end we try as a
marketing company to build the best
brand position for our product to have
some strength in the marketplace and to
consume or capture market share as much
market share as possible in our market
and there are a number of economic
forces that are there going to be in
operation that are going to impact you
there's a cycle that occurs in n
economies where just the economic
conditions will move from prosperity to
recession to depression and back into a
recovery sort of a mode back into a
prosperity mode and so depending on that
where you're at in that cycle consumers
will be more or less willing to spend
their money and and they are likely to
have more or less buying power so
knowing how much money your consumer
your knowing how much money your target
customers have to spend what is their
buying power and what is their
willingness to spend those things are
important to you as a marketer
the third and fourth categories of
discussion here for the marketing
environment tend to go together so I'm
going to talk about them together
political forces and legal and
regulatory forces okay so it is
important as it as a company to be in
the good graces of the political
realities of that marketplace okay so
it's a good idea to not to not have any
operations that are going to offend the
local government advocacy groups that
kind of thing and so you'll see that
companies put quite a lot of effort into
monitoring relations with political
entities and so that's just smart
business because it can help you avoid a
lot of different different problems in
your community and actually those your
customer base too so you you need to be
in touch with with their expectations
okay so legislation and regulatory
agencies have are more official here
we're talking about laws and groups
organizations that have some teeth to
control what you do so we do have a
number of pro-competitive
laws on the books know something about
some of the major ones discussed in the
chapter and those laws really are meant
to encourage competition between
companies and so the second category
here are consumer protection laws they
relate to packaging labeling consumer
safety hazardous materials that kind of
thing
of course we all know that computers are
everywhere the Internet has changed the
way business is conducted and so
technology is important not only in the
opportunities opportunities that it
represents to sell different and new
products but also because it has
impacted the way companies do business
and how they communicate with their
market and sell their products you have
to be able to keep up as a company so
that your competitors aren't aren't able
to do something that you can't do
technologically but you also need to
protect your own intellectual property
and make sure that your competitors can
also get their hands on it of course
that's important to your own business
success
socio-cultural forces are such humongous
impact on how you do business because
these these forces represent the
characteristics of your customer base
your demographics for your marketplace
do change for example we have a
population that is growing older here in
the United States so there's more
opportunity to sell products to older
generations what do they need what what
products would appeal to them and so you
have to know what those what those
realities are have to be in touch with
your customers that way also we have a
higher population of single parents so
they of course have different needs than
the traditional family and so that
changes the way marketers will gear
their product development to our
population is becoming more diverse we
have a more diverse customer base here
in the US than we've ever had and of
course with that comes different
cultural values so as a marketer you
need to be in touch with with what your
customers feel what they believe what
their attitudes are and it's just hugely
important to knowing what sorts of
products will appeal to them and what
their expectations are of you as a as a
company consumerism is a movement that
has come along here in recent times to
really be an advocate of the customer
and their particular rights and so as a
marketer you just need to be more aware
that there's a demand among customers to
be treated as well and and and people
fight for that actually so you just have
to to be a good citizen in that way
wrapping up chapter 3
know the difference between monopoly and
an oligopoly monopolistic and pure
competition know the difference between
disposable and discretionary income and
the stages of the business cycle all of
these actually are important I guess I
don't need to read them to you but take
a look at them and let me know if you
have any questions and I hope you have a
good rest of your week
Thanks

## Chapter 5
 Chapter 5 really is going to talk about research in two major categories.
So we have exploratory research which is really exploratory so basically you're trying to
better understand something and you don't necessarily know what you're looking for.
Versus conclusive research where you're looking for information that's going to help you make
some decisions.
So with respect to conclusive research we have descriptive research which is more descriptive
in nature.
You're trying to understand characteristics of a target audience, maybe demographic qualities
of an audience or who are your competitors in a market that sort of thing.
Versus experimental where you are really looking to establish a cause and effect.
So if we increase our advertising dollars in this way, we should see this ramp up to
our sales in this market something like that.
A fair amount of the chapter is spent going over marketing research process.
There's five steps so the first thing you need to do is be clear about what it is you're
looking to understand.
So identify the issue or the problem that you need to explore.
And then you will go into designing your project.
So you'll go into a project with some sort of a thought or hypothesis about what you're
thinking you are going to find.
And then your looking to substantiate that position ok?
So you have to have a plan, so if you think that your population in Cincinnati of new
mom's would be interested in a product that will help them to better bathe a newborn
infant, then you would think about ok that's my problem I need to find data if that's correct
and then you need some kind of plan to go about gathering that information.
So are you going to do a survey, are you going to do a web-based sort of approach with the
survey are you going to go door-to-door?
Are you going to do a phone interview sort of a process.
In other words, how exactly are you thinking you are going about collecting this information?
And you can collect information yourself, so you go about finding the information first-hand
or you can use secondary data, which basically leverages a lot of information that's available
to you as a marketer online or in data bases.
But it's information that was collected for another purpose.
But maybe you can use it for what you're after and if you can, that's a great way to go about
collecting data.
You can get a lot of information and cheaply from secondary data sources.
Primary data collection tends to be quite expensive and more time consuming but many
times it's the only way to get at what you really want to know, ok?
Once you've gone about and collected your data, then you are analyzing your data it's
a good idea to have a way to quantify your data.
So if you can plot and make a picture or graph of your findings, sometimes that helps a lot
to give you a picture of what you have found or what you got.
This is where also you would apply some statistical analysis to your data, depending on the data
you've collected to give you some indication of whether you have a substantial finding.
Is it true that new moms really do care about coloring and baby food or do they not really
care that much?
So you may have to quantify that result and put some statistical strength to your findings
to see if it is significant enough for you to care about.
Ok and then finally you'll report your findings so if you are in marketing research in the
business world, generally you are collecting information for somebody else.
And so you will put it together in a report and there are tips and tricks to making that
sort of report appealing and convincing and persuasive to the significant others that
you're responsible to.
So the chapter just deals with that a little bit.
But it's important.
We use technology constantly in business, constantly.
And you probably do already even as a student, but I can tell you in the business world I
probably always had 10-15 different applications open on my computer at any given time.
Businesses are run on information.
And so management information systems are those systems you use in your job that bring
you information that you use all the time.
I can't think of a business that I've been involved with that doesn't have a management
information system.
A lot of times you'll be using data bases or collections of data that you'll need to
refer to in order to make decisions.
So, if you are, for example, calculating commissions for your sales people, you may need to reference
a data base where their sales for the quarter have been downloaded into a data base, okay,
that sort of thing.
Big data is looking out in the market in avenues that give you massive amounts of data and
using technological tools that are available to help you make sense of huge amounts of
data, okay.
And then finally, the MDSS sorts of systems, these are systems that let you project what
will happen if we do this.
So again, if we ramp up our advertising dollars in this sort of a publication, what can we
expect to have happen with our sales, or our market share.
Finally, these chapter deals a little bit with ethical and international issues related
to marketing research.
As far as the ethical side of things, privacy is maybe the biggest issue.
We all know what it's like to get somebody calling our home in the middle of dinner wanting
to do a survey, or looking online for something, for some information, and having to sign up
for somebody's mailing list in order to get some information.
There's a line that some of us will not be comfortable with and so marketers need to
be sensitive to that.
And some of those lines are still being, I guess, defined for us in the market place
and even legislatively.
So just know that privacy is a huge issue and to the extent you can be sensitive to
that, it should help you with your customer base.
And finally, boy, if market research is important, domestically, if you are going into an international
market, it's hugely important.
The text book is going to recommend, and I guess I can substantiate this with my own
experience that use of secondary resources first is a good way to start, and you can
get a lot of information through secondary data about the market you're going into.
But when it comes to actually being in the market, you really need to be interfacing
with people that are there that know the culture, know the people, have the connections.
Those will be the people that can really help you penetrate a market.
And so if you can find those sorts of partners, you'll do much better internationally.
Alright, things you need to know from chapter 5.
Some terms here: what's a hypothesis?
What's the difference between reliability and validity?
What are the different sorts of sampling options that are available to you and why do you want
to use one over the other?
What's a population?
What's a, I guess I should speak to that, it's not on this list, but when you are doing
market research you are looking to know something about your population or your target market.
And so that is everybody that might potentially, everybody that's apart of the group that you're
interested in, okay, that's your population.
But if your population is the state of Texas, or everybody that lives in the south, southern
part of the united states, you're not going to be able to find out the opinions of all
of those people, so you'll have to choose a representative sample, or a sample from
that group to try to learn about them.
And so you can imagine that if you choose the wrong sample, you're not going to get
good information about your population.
And so there's a lot of mathematical sorts of tools that you can use to develop a representative
sample to allow you to get good data that represents a total population.
So maybe I should have talked more about that earlier, but anyway.
Know something about that.
And also, finally, so a lot of different survey methods that are discussed in chapter 5, and
so know something about the different options and their strengths and weaknesses depending
on what you're trying to do with your market research.
That buttons it up for chapter 5.
Do let me know if you have questions, and have a good rest of your week.
Thanks, bye.

## Chapter 6
 Good afternoon.
Today we are talking about chapter 6 which has to do with how marketers segment, define,
evaluate their target markets.
Remember from our prior conversations what exactly is a target market?
The target market is the group of people that represent your customer base.
So in order to be a valid target market, you're looking for a group that is willing to buy
your product, able to buy your product they have the funds to do that or the other resources
they would need, and they have the authority to purchase your product or engage in an exchange
with you.
They have to meet those three qualities to be a target market.
Alright, so recall also that the two major outputs of a marketing strategy or the strategic
planning process are a target market and a marketing mix.
So your selection of a target market is strategically
quite important and a major step in your planning process.
There are five steps that are worked through in the definition of a target market
and we're going to be speaking today about each of those.
First of all, what is your targeting strategy going to be.
What segmentation variables will you be using to define your market segments.
And then you will develop a profile for your market segments, evaluate them in terms of
their potential for you, and then ultimately choose your target market or markets.
So first of all, step one, what is your targeting strategy going to be?
If you are going to pursue an undifferentiated targeting strategy, you are saying that you
believe the entire market is homogeneous with the same needs and the same characteristics
and that you can use a single marketing mix to approach that entire market.
So your approach is then undifferentiated, it's the same across all of the people that
you're hoping to reach with your marketing mix.
This is different from a concentrated or a differentiated marketing targeting strategy in that
with these second and third categories, you are understanding that the needs of different
customers are different.
Your target audiences are heterogeneous so they are not all the same.
Therefore, the way that you approach one group of people with that marketing mix needs to
be different from the way you would approach a different group of people and the marketing
mix that you would use to reach that group.
So if you're choosing just one specific target market that needs a specific marketing mix,
you call that a concentrated targeting strategy.
If you're looking at two or more specific groups with two or more specific defined marketing
mixes, that would be a differentiated targeting strategy.
Alright, so step two.
How do you go about segmenting a group of people?
Well you look to different qualities that characterize different people into different
groups so those might be demographic qualities, geographic, psychographic, or behavioristic.
So demographic qualities have to do with things like age, gender, income, education level.
These sorts of qualities are readily available to you, it's not hard to identify a group
of people that might be between ages 25 and 50 for example or to think about targeting
just women between those age parameters for example.
But that's what you're getting at with demographic qualities.
Geographic on the other hand has to do with more geographic locations so maybe you're
looking at people that live along the coast versus people that live in cities.
You might be looking at certain kinds of climates so people that live in the mountains you have
a market there for ski equipment that you wouldn't have with people that live in Florida,
for example.
Pychographic variables have to do with personality or lifestyle, a customer group's motives for
purchasing something.
Maybe they're more concerned with their appearance or esteem status or that kind of thing.
And so you can appeal to those psychographic qualities with that variable focus.
And behavioristic has to do with how a product will be used.
It can also encompass things like pricing sensitivity, things like that.
Alright, so those are the four major categories and so once you define how you're going to
try and segment your market based on the product that you have to sell, then you can think
about developing a market profile.
So, in other words, you're creating a picture of who your target audience is.
So, for example, you might have a market for your product that would appeal to soccer moms
and you might have an idea in your head that what does a soccer mom look like?
What's their gender?
What's their age group?
What do they do, are they working outside the home or you know you just get a real picture
when you say something as simple as soccer moms.
Or you might say young professional, what does that mean?
So you immediately would have a picture in your mind of the sort of person that would
be a young professional.
Educated, between 25 and 40 probably, likely to be concerned with their appearance and
upwardly mobile or really wanting to impress people that sort of thing.
So then once you've identified and kind of built a market profile, then you really need to
consider what is your potential for reaching out to this market and to do that, you need
to understand what's the entire market potential.
So industry wide, if you're selling let's say coffee beans, what is the market for coffee
beans in whatever area you're talking about marketing to.
So, if you're marketing in the U.S., what's the industry wide sales of coffee beans in
the U.S.
And then you could break that down by different parts of the country if you're targeting a
specific geographic potential area, for example.
This is different, market potential is different from sales potential which is more specific
to your company.
So, you do understand what the market potential is, but then of that market, what is your company's
potential for sales.
And you can do that by starting at the top, looking at the industry and working your way
back to what your company's potential in that industry could be, or you can start from the
bottom up, then look at your costs and what, how many people that you think you could reach
in your specific area, and building your projections up from the bottom in that way.
So top down or bottom up sort of an approach.
And then thirdly, you can be looking at more of a profit potential perspective which requires
you to get your arms around cost, and understand that some markets may be more costly to try
to reach out to then others, which implies that they are going to be less profitable.
Alright, so finally, you would select the target market that you're going after, and
if you've identified multiple markets that are very attractive, you might change your
mind on your targeting strategy.
For example, instead of an undifferentiated approach, you decided that now you really
think that you want to do a differentiated targeting strategy, and reach out to two different
markets that have great potential for you as a company.
So there can be a little bit of back and forth in this process.
Alright, so I think that's just about all I'm going to say about chapter 6, but I've
got a few more points here for you that I'll mention just real quick.
There are differences between consumer markets and business markets, but in some ways they
are quite the same.
So, I think probably the biggest differences are that business markets are concerned with,
well when you're approaching a business market, you need to be concerned with the type of
organization you're dealing with: there'll be a specific organizational culture, the
size of the company will be important, there's just other factors that come into how you
approach that potential customer, or potential customer group.
Let's see, know the difference between geographic segmentation, which is the process of separating
a market, potential market, into, based on geographic, sometimes very fine geographic,
degradation's, even down to a neighborhood level.
So know that that is the process of segmented versus micro marketing, which is going after,
and how you specifically target those finally defined geographic markets, okay.
Benefit segmentation, in this category you are looking to serve a particular benefit
for a particular group of customers.
And so, maybe you're looking to new moms who have children with extremely sensitive skin,
and so they're looking for a very specific benefit for your product to serve, and you
can speak to that in your marketing efforts.
Sales Forecasts, there's a section in chapter 6 that deals with the difference sorts of
sales forecasting options available to you.
So, if you are a company, after you've defined your target market, your potential in that
market, then you really do have to get even more specific and define what your foretasted
sales for a particular market would be.
And you can do that based off of surveys, where you're talking to potential customers,
or your sales force, you might do that with time series analysis, regression analysis.
There's several methods that are discussed in the book.
And I can tell you, having done some of this is my own career, that they're spot on in
terms of what company's are doing.
In my experience, I would talk to my sales force, and get them to go out and talk to
their customers, their big customers especially, and come up with a quarterly projection for
what they would need for a particular product in the upcoming several months.
And then I would also be looking at a three month rolling average sort of an analysis,
that looked back in time, and even seasonally, to see, what did we sell of this product last
year, two years ago, based on this time of the year, and can we project anything going
forward based on that sort of a history.
Regression analysis is looking more at causal affect, do certain factors impact sales in
a predictable way.
And there are two other categories that are discussed in the book, executive judgement
and market tests.
I haven't personally used market tests, but executive judgement I think may commonly play
into the process where, even though I would come up with a forecast, I would give it to
my vice president, and he would take my data and he might tweek it based on his own particular
feeling or judgement about maybe new customers that he thought he might be able to bring
on board, that kind of thing.
Anyway, this is one of my favorite things about marketing, has to do with segmenting
markets and being very strategic about how you choose your potential customer base.
Love this topic, let me know if you have any questions.
And I will be back again to talk about chapter 7. 

---
## Chapter 8
 Good morning.
Today we're talking about chapter eight, which has to do with business markets.
I love this topic.
I would say maybe 90% of my own personal career in the private sector was working with business
customers.
22 years, something like that.
Let's start off by just understanding what the different types of business markets are.
There's three categories really that would qualify you as a business customer.
First of all, if you are purchasing a product in order to resell it to somebody else, to
a consumer, that would be called a reseller sort of a business customer.
The second one would be if you are purchasing a product to use it as part of a product that
you manufacture, then you would be a producer sort of a business customer.
Thirdly, if you are purchasing a product to use it in your business, you would be a business
customer.
Government markets, institutional markets, they tend to be those sorts of customers but
you can think, too, if you are a business customer and you need to purchase ink toner
for your computers or furniture for your offices.
You're a business customer but you're using those products in your business.
Those are the major categories.
Just one distinction here, government markets are business customers that are funded by
the government.
These could be schools, government offices at a state, local, federal level, those sorts
of customers.
Institutions, on the other hand, tend to be non-profit sorts of organizations.
These might be churches, charities, privately funded schools, that kind of thing.
Business customers are different from consumers in that they tend to purchase large quantities,
so they're much bigger dollar potential for you.
These sorts of customers tend to become long-term relations, so you are working with these people
over a long period of time.
If you can establish a relationship that's a win-win between the two of you, you'll probably
work with these guys, like I said, for years, for a long time.
The negotiations to get those contracts set up are longer.
You tend to see reciprocal sorts of agreements where you try to find occasions where you
can help each other.
That sort of reciprocity happens a lot.
There's more at stake with a business customer with each potential purchase than with a consumer
typically.
All right, attributes of a business customer.
Business customers tend to be pretty informed.
They know a lot about what they do.
It's their job.
They're working with specifications for product needs and they're very educated with respect
to what's available on the market typically, so they'll tend to be tough cookies, tough
customers for you.
They do want to have good relationships with their suppliers.
If you can build that sort of a partnership with them, again looking for win-win situations,
that will help you out definitely.
Business customers are concerned with price, but they're also concerned with quality.
You have to think if you're running a business, your suppliers who are giving you your products
may make or break you as a company.
You need to have suppliers that you can rely on.
While they do care about price, they really do care about service and the relationship
that goes with that relationship with you as a potential vendor.
If you're selling a product to a business customer, sometimes they'll just take your
description of what it is you have to offer, looking at the specifications on the product.
Sometimes they'll want to see it.
If it's a major piece of equipment, that kind of thing, they may want you to bring it to
them to test it out or to demo it.
If it's a corn product, they may want to see a sample of it, for example.
It just depends on the nature of the product that you're selling.
If it's a commodity type of product versus a major piece of equipment, that kind of thing.
You can expect to have negotiations where we're looking, can we get a better price if
we buy it in bulk?
Who else are you selling this product to?
Especially like for resellers; they may want to protect a territory.
They may want to be the only company selling a particular product in a particular region,
so you'll see those sorts of negotiations coming into play with your business customers.
As far as types of of purchases, the first purchase with a new supplier or your first
sale to a new potential business customer is likely to be an extended, drawn out sort
of an experience.
It'll take some time to set up that first purchase.
Make sure all the product specs are met.
Make sure you're all comfortable with the terms.
There may be a contract involved.
After that, you're much more likely to see a straight rebuy sort of a scenario where
you may just see a purchase order come through and you just ship the product.
You may not even need to talk to the guy or your partner on the other side.
That would be a straight rebuy.
A modified rebuy is somewhere in the middle.
You know enough about the product to know you want maybe something a little different.
Maybe you want the delivery variables to be slightly different.
You need to ship it by air instead of by truck, or you need something in a different color,
you need a different quantity, that kind of thing.
A modified rebuy is less extensive a process than an a new-task purchase but more involved
than a straight rebuy.
Let's talk about demand.
If you're a business customer, typically you're selling product to a consumer.
Many times, your demand for a product is going to be based on the consumer's demand for the
product.
If you're selling cereal product and all of a sudden consumers don't like oatmeal, your
demand for oats from the growers may be less than it was before.
It's a long, drawn out explanation but your business customers demand for their product
is coming from the consumers, and that's called derived demand.
Inelastic demand is a little different.
If you have a product that you sell and your customers buy it with relatively no sensitivity
to the price, that's considered to be an inelastic demand situation.
Let's say you are a manufacturer of gasoline.
People need gasoline in their cars to go to work, and so you may find that your sales
of gasoline are relatively stable regardless of any sort of a price fluctuation because
people have to have gas.
Joint demand is a situation where the demand for one product goes with the demand for another
product.
If you have demand for ink toner that varies along with demand for printer products, then
those two would be considered to have joint demand.
Tires with car sales, peanut butter with jelly.
If you've got two products that are going together and the demand for one is impacted
by the demand of the other, those have a joint demand scenario.
Fluctuating demand just means that demand is varying or changing for some reason.
It could be related to consumer demand changes, pricing that's impacting demand.
It may just be a time of the year.
Certain products are in more demand.
Plastic Easter eggs are much more in demand during March/April than they are in December,
right?
That's a fluctuating demand scenario.
All right, moving on.
When you are selling to a business customer, generally there's a group of people involved
and you can think of this as the buying center.
Typically, there's one person that gets to make the decision, the go, no-go.
This is the person who's deciding whether or not they're going to buy the product.
There's lots of other people involved.
You may have the actual user of the product that's playing in here, people that are influencing
the purchase decision, these could be engineers, salespeople, people who have some kind of
an inside information about what features are really wanted in the product.
Gatekeepers are especially important.
These are people that can keep you from having access to the decision-makers.
Back in my day when I was on the phone calling for potential distributors, you make friends
with the gatekeepers because they're the ones that give you all kinds of great information.
Typically from the gatekeeper, you can find out who the decision-makers are and if there
are other people involved in the process that you might need to know.
The purchasing manager, for example, or engineers that are working with the job.
When you are selling to a business customer, it's very important for you to make sure you
know who all of these players are.
You can just ask, "Who's the decision-maker on this project?"
Those sorts of questions are completely valid and expected actually.
The stages of the buying process for a business sale are very similar to what you see with
a consumer decision-making process.
They tend to be more driven by product specifications though.
In step two here where you are, in the consumer case, searching for your choices, in the business
case you're trying to match a product spec.
From the buyer perspective, you're searching for a supplier that can give you the product
that meets the specs and that meets your need from a supplier perspective.
You may want suppliers that can ship in a certain time frame or that give you certain
purchase terms, net 30 day terms for example.
You may have requirements as a company for what your suppliers have to do for you.
Training, collateral materials, all of those sorts of things play in there.
After you've done your search, you've chosen your supplier, you go ahead and purchase your
products, and then you're evaluating this relationship with this new supplier.
Do you like him?
Do you work well together?
Are they friendly?
Are they helpful?
Did the product do what they said?
I can't tell you how common it is that salespeople will sell a business product and they really
don't know much about it.
They're just salespeople.
If you can find a supplier that really knows what they're talking about and services you
well, that's worth a lot in a business-to-business sort of a relationship.
There are a lot of factors that do influence the business buying process.
Just like with a consumer case, you've got all of the environmental impactors, technological,
competitive, socio-cultural, political, legal, regulatory, all of those.
I would say from the business buying perspective, they're a little bit more focused on competition.
When you're running a business, you're not just using this product for yourself typically.
Typically, you're operating in a competitive environment.
You're looking for products that are going to help give you a competitive edge.
That does play into the products that you ultimately choose.
Organizational factors will impact a buying decision.
You may have rules inside your own organization about what suppliers must do for you.
Those may play in.
Interpersonal, I mean you're building a relationship here between the business, customer, and the
supplier.
There's a relationship going on there.
If that's not a positive relationship, if you're just not meshing well or not working
well together, you're going to have an issue.
Finally, individual factors are important.
If you're selling to a business customer and your counterpart there is 65 and you're 23,
you may have an issue in that case because the person you're selling to, he may want
to deal with somebody that's simply older.
These are just individual factors you may not be able to control.
You just have to be aware of who it is you're trying to sell to and just try to meet their
needs the best you can and build that relationship.
If there's somebody else in your organization that can better build that relationship with
this business customer, sometimes you can just put another salesperson on the project
and have them build with somebody they're more comfortable with or interact with somebody
they're more comfortable with.
Relationship is huge with business customers.
That's really maybe the bottom line.
Alright, so let's talk just briefly about industrial classification systems.
You don't really think about this maybe when you're dealing with business customers, but
if you think from a great big picture like a 30,000 foot government level.
As a government, you want to keep track of what businesses are happening in your country,
what your product sales are out of each of your business categories.
We talk a lot about countries that import so many dollars worth of grain every year
or manufacture so many dollars worth of computer products.
We know those things because the government is keeping track of what industries are producing
what in our country based on these industrial classification systems.
Before NAFTA, we used a system called the SIC: Standard Industrial Classification I
think is what it stands for.
When NAFTA came along, we redefined that system and it's now shared between the United States,
Mexico, and Canada.
What it does is it just classifies all of the industries that are existing in those
three countries.
Then when sales are happening between those different categories of companies, they're
tallied and their activity at a country level is tallied by these industries.
It's great for marketers too actually because you can use these industrial classification
systems to identify target markets.
If you're selling copper, for example, you may look for potential customers based on
their industrial classification systems and you can actually get company names, addresses,
phone numbers, and all kinds of good information based on this classification system that you
can use to help you build your own business.
They are important.
In Europe, the system's a little different.
It's called the ISIC system: International Standard Industrial Classification system
I think is what it's called for there.
That really wraps it up for chapter eight.
Do let me know if you have any questions, and I will be back to talk about chapter nine.
Thanks, bye.

## Chapter 9
 We are talking today about chapter nine, which has to do with global marketing.
So, if you are a business in the United States and you have any sort of import/export or
any dealings with another country, then you are an international marketing company, okay.
There's varying levels of that.
You can be more or less involved with an international set of customers.
We'll talk more about that.
Alright, so. Dealing with global markets, the same environmental forces are at work as with domestic markets,
but you can think of them as being on steroids a little bit.
Everything is a little different than what you're used to.
Everything is a little more complicated than what you're used to.
So you just have to be more involved with these elements than maybe you are at a domestic
level.
So umm, socioculturally speaking, you're dealing with cultures that you're potentially unfamiliar
with.
Different sets of values, different social rules in operation that you just have got
to get familiar with so that you know your customer, and you know what's appropriate
for you to be saying and doing with that customer.
Even with respect to your products, your advertising.
Everything about how you build your marketing mix has to be sensitive to the local cultural
norms.
Economically speaking, many times people look at international market opportunities with
respect to GDP.
How much money is moving in the international market that you're looking at?
How much income do these people have?
What's their buying power?
Again, it's the same elements that you're used to domestically, but maybe at a larger
scale.
You're looking at the opportunity for the whole country.
Exchange rates are an issue there.
What's the US dollar worth respectively in that international market?
That's going to be different from one country to another.
So you may be more or less profitable in another country simply based on the exchange rate.
Political, legal, and regulatory is huge.
Not only because there are laws that are going to be new and different, but also because
countries tend to restrict international business in their country with respect to using the legal rules of
the country to do that.
So you're going to see the impact of tariffs, quotas.
There may be embargoes going on.
The country may have exchange controls in place to limit the amount of business that
happens, the amount of money, foreign currencies that are spent in their country.
That kind of thing.
Countries are trying to balance their imports and exports, so that's what balance of trade
has to do with.
I won't speak too much to competitive and technological except that there are some countries
in the world that are known to be more competitive than others.
I think Switzerland is right up there at the top of the list as being one of the most competitive
countries.
You can find this information out.
You're going to have a different set of competitors internationally than you would domestically.
It's just like relearning everything in the United States but for another country, for
another new, different environment.
We have this added element.
You may have noticed that for the global markets, political, legal, and regulatory are lumped
together where there's two separate categories were defined here for the consumer, customers.
In addition here to this list, we've added ethical and social responsibility.
The major point here is that what is ethical in our country may not be ethical in another
country and vice versa.
What we think of as unacceptable, they may think is acceptable.
That whole concept is called cultural relativism.
Just know what that means, and get comfortable with the idea that what's okay here is maybe
not there and vice versa.
You're going to be potentially dealing with much more corruption, much more corrupt business
practices in other countries.
So that's just something that you need to be aware of and ready to deal with.
Let's talk just a little bit about trade alliances and agreements.
When you're dealing with international business, you're dealing with politics.
That is just a reality.
A lot of money is moving between these countries, and there's a lot at stake.
So now it's not just a business-to-business sort of relationship.
You've got your country's government involved with another country's government.
There's a lot of very significant trade agreements in place that are going to impact you.
NAFTA, of course, is huge.
This is between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, virtually eliminating all tariffs
between those countries.
There's a huge annual output from these three nations, $17 trillion dollars annually.
So huge.
And I expect we'll see some changes to that with the Trump organization.
From a business perspective, that's something international companies are watching, definitely.
In the EU, the European Union, this has also been majorly in the news here lately with
Brexit and the UK opting out.
We have a common currency in Europe for most of the countries involved.
Sixteen trillion GDP.
This is 7% of the world population that represents 22% of the world GDP, so we're talking about
a very important part of the world.
This group is involved not only in trade cooperation, but they're looking to establish Europe as
a power in the world and have the respect of the world.
So there's some political agenda here as well with this group.
Alright moving on to MERCOSUR.
This is a southern common market established in 1991, and now we have, looks like 10 or
so member countries in South America.
Two-thirds of the South American population and about three trillion GDP.
So again, an important part of the world.
This is an agreement that fosters free trade between the member countries.
So um MERCOSUR.
Let's go on to APEC.
APEC is huge.
We've got 21 member countries.
It started out with just the more of the Asian-Pacific countries, but now we have Russia in here,
Canada, Australia, the United States.
This is a very important political group.
Represents 40% of the world population, 55% of the world GDP, and 44% of all global trade
by this group.
We're looking not only for open trade between member countries but economic and technical
cooperation between these different countries.
Very important political associations here.
Alright.
The ASEAN market.
ASEAN, I'm not quite sure how we say that.
Association of Southeast Asian countries.
Six hundred million population, 5% GDP growth.
This is a group of countries where the GDP is rapidly growing, and this is expected to
be a much more important part of the world by 2020.
Moving on.
Finally, the World Trade Organization has come under a lot of criticism here in recent
years for corrupt practices, but the intent of the organization is to establish some ground
rules for international trade and to foster trade throughout the world.
That's the intent.
There's 159 member nations and again, this is a hugely important political group.
If you want to go international, you can baby step it by starting to do some importing and
exporting.
I did that in my career.
I think I only really had about three years of international sales.
But in that time, in my first year, tripled international sales for my little barcode
reader company.
It's not that hard to do.
You just have to get comfortable with the rules and the processes.
Working with the border, transfer of goods, and that kind of thing.
So you can import/export as a small company and be quite successful with it.
You can leverage trading companies to help you find buyers and sellers in different country
markets.
If you want to go a little bigger, you can license companies in other countries to use
your product name or your company name.
You can work with vendors in other countries to manufacture parts of your product.
Or you can outsource certain parts of your company processes to other countries.
Put call centers in India, for example.
If you want to go a little bigger, you can set up a joint venture where you may have
a shared ownership with an operation in another country.
Or you can have a facility that you fully own in another country.
That's a much bigger investment, direct ownership.
At this level, if you have operations in multiple countries, you're considered a multi-national
enterprise.
I'm not going to speak too much about structuring your operations.
Just know that it's a concern.
If you are doing business internationally, you need to set up your infrastructure in
your company to handle that.
It may be as simple as having an export department.
I was an export department for Percon who made barcode readers at one point.
Then we had a little international division.
There was a group of us, a small group, that had some expertise in the paperwork that was
required.
We worked with our group of customers.
We shared facilities with the domestic operations, the shipping department, the accounts receivable.
All of that was shared.
When you get to an internationally integrated structure, now you're talking about a bigger
company.
They may situate an international operation, have a headquarters in another country, for
example.
They may have a product division that's specific for their international customers.
Anyway, they're just more sophisticated at that level and more integrated and tend to
have all of the pieces that are needed for international business in one place.
Sales, purchasing, accounts receivable, accounts payable, human resources.
All of those things may be self-contained when you have an internationally integrated
structure.
Enough about that.
Finally, and perhaps one of the most important things about international marketing, is that
you have to figure out what pieces of your marketing mix need to be customized for an
international market.
Do you need a product that looks different?
That's named different?
That has different features that are specific to the needs of a particular international
market?
Is the distribution different in another country?
Do they have the same sorts of retail outlets?
What do you need to do differently as far as getting your product to market in another
country?
Does the pricing need to be set up different?
Do coupons work the same way?
Can you have ad specials in the same way?
Do you need to bundle products differently?
As far as promotion, this is a big one.
You have to be sensitive to the cultural norms, what's appropriate, what's not appropriate.
Even something as simple as a color means something different in another country.
So you have to be quite sensitive to all of that when you're talking about international
marketing.
Alright.
That is it for chapter nine today.
Do let me know if you have questions.
I guess I'll be back with chapter eleven next time.
Have a good one.
Bye.

## Chapter 10
 hello we are today discussing chapter 10
which is all about digital marketing and
social networking and how that has
transformed the world of marketing oh my
goodness
I don't know if you guys can even
imagine what the world was like before
we had Facebook but let me tell you for
a marketer for example just think about
marketer trying to collect information
on competitor products for example back
in my day which was so long ago now you
know we can get on the Internet there
wasn't an internet to get on and go find
information about competitor products so
we collected trade journals and looked
in those we went to trade shows which
you know was a lot of travel made a lot
of phone calls and dug around trying to
get information from different
distributors and different customers and
sneak information from the manufacturers
themselves it was just a much different
world than we have today and so chapter
10 is just trying to kind of get your
arms around the vastness of what has
happened to marketing with the evolution
of digital media and our opportunity to
reach customers that way so we'll go
ahead and jump in the digital marketing
is a marketing effort that uses any of
the digital media opportunities which is
any media that uses a digital code so
that would be anything you can think of
related to a computer or the Internet
so laptop anything on the Internet
iPad smartphone even an electronic
billboard would be considered a digital
media
okay so digital marketing uses any of
these channels to interface with
customers and and communicate in that
way this is different from emarketing
because e marketing includes all of the
ancillary support that goes with a
digital marketing effort so all of the
planning all of the distribution
development
all of the production of collateral
materials development a product that
would be specific for delivery via the
internet anything related to it so it
may not necessarily be involving digital
media when you talk about emarketing
hopefully that makes sense
benefits are huge huge and I started to
talk about some of them but first of all
we have a vastly greater vehicle now for
sharing information than we used to have
the for digital media came along in
order to even be competitive anymore
companies need to be present on social
media or communicate in a digital way in
a digital media method but not only that
having these new channels allows
companies to create and tap new
opportunities that never even used to
exist so a huge opportunity to to create
financial benefit using digital
marketing there are some particular
characteristics about digital media that
are different from non digital media so
first of all it from the marketers
perspective we have the issue or the
element of address ability in that
companies can use digital media to to go
about identifying prospective customers
it's an interactive sort of a platform
so customers have the ability to voice
their opinions communicate their
thoughts and their feedback and their
ideas to companies that are selling
products it's very accessible for both
marketers and for customers and it's it
allows for connectivity so consumers can
connect with other consumers as well as
with the companies that they're buying
products from and finally there's a much
greater degree of control in that
consumers can decide how much
information they want and they can
control how it comes to them and what
sequence and in what sequence so these
are these are unique sorts of qualities
maybe one of the very biggest important
about digital media is that it tends to
be customer driven and so here we have a
new trend happening in the marketing
world and that consumers are actually
publishing their own thoughts and ideas
and putting them out into the
marketplace and not only that but
consumers trust other consumers and so
here you have a huge element of control
kind of shifting into the hands of
consumers so that companies have to
address this or in a deal with this in
some way because it's such a powerful
force that it's not something that can
simply be ignored all right so let's go
briefly and you all probably know more
about the digital media options than I
do but give you a list here we have
social networks so these would include
Facebook Twitter Google+ we have blogs
and Wickard wiki's so we have tumblr and
Wikipedia would fall into these
categories we have media sharing sites
Pinterest Instagram couple of examples
virtual gaming sites and we have mobile
devices so text messaging multimedia
messaging multimedia sorts of different
advertising methods that happen via
mobile devices and then finally we have
applications and widgets so of course we
are all familiar with apps and widgets
are like little self-contained pieces of
software that you can pop into into any
electronic platform to deliver a
particular piece of information like the
weather or stock price that kind of
thing okay so know something about those
in what's what's unique to each of the
categories but I'm not going to spend a
lot of time on them all right so let's
talk about our online community and
somebody some research company has
created the term social technocratic
to capture the different sorts of
players that we have in in the online
community so we'll talk about these
levels creators of the most active level
these are people who are writing blogs
creating content and publishing it on
the internet for the rest of us
about conversationalist these are people
who have post updates on Facebook and
Twitter social networking sorts of sites
they're not creating content the way
that creators do critics these are
people who are posting reviews and
commenting reacting in in other words to
content that's out there collectors
these are people that are using
information that comes to them and
electronic means I don't know they're
just not as involved as critics so
joiners is the next level down and these
are people who have profiles and visit
social networking sites they're just not
very engaged they're spectators these
are people who read blogs and reviews
but they're not creating content and
really they're not they're not involved
in social networking sites and then
finally we have inactives who are really
not involved with digital marketing at
all okay so those are your categories
think about who you are and where you
live in the in lot in the online
community if I were to put myself in
here I would probably say I'm a
conversationalist and maybe well I think
the book said the most common character
category is the spectator so see what
you think about that all right so let's
talk about more of a marketing
perspective now if you are a marketing
manager how do you leverage the e
marketing opportunities available to you
of course we have to talk about the four
PS so first of all from a product
perspective it's all about meeting
customer needs and so you need to be
thinking about what are your
opportunities to deliver product and a
better way to customers and this may
have a lot to do with services providing
more information being able to collect
customer feedback about products in
order to spawn new product ideas that
kind of thing
okay regarding distribution the internet
or digital media or an opportunity to
create a new channel
for distributing product and so you can
think about distribution of information
even how do customers get access to
their orders or their order history it's
an opportunity to improve communication
speed the big deals here in this area
are dealing with shipping time and cost
and all you have to do is look at Amazon
to just see how incredible companies
have gotten at conquering these
challenges and really creating an
important distribution channel via the
internet amazing
all right regarding promotion of course
you can do so much to promote a product
on the internet but this is also a great
Avenue for building customer
relationships and developing your brand
equity not just for consumers but for
b2b business to business sorts of
opportunities huge promotion
opportunities with the internet and
digital marketing and finally with
regard to price we know we all shop for
price on the internet so there's
definitely the opportunity to compete on
a price basis via digital marketing but
you can also amp up your non-price
competition strengths here by promoting
benefits of your products that are that
are worth more and that you can charge a
higher price for so you can augment your
non-price competition on the Internet as
well all right so let's talk about the
the major kind of sticking points or big
issues that that are impacting digital
marketing in our generation okay so
first of all privacy is huge
we know we have hackers in our world
that are that are trying to get our
information get our address get access
to our kids
get access to our personal finances and
information and so we are still in the
midst as a global unit trying to figure
out how best to address privacy issues
on the internet and how to protect where
we need to protect a huge issue of
course and let's see
okay so secondly digital marketing is
represents a lot of opportunity for
online fraud so anything that is a
dishonest sort of an activity on the
Internet would constitute online fraud
so whether you're ochita trying to
solicit money from people for a false
company or for under a false pretense or
if you're trying to if you've got a
false facebook profile for example where
you're presenting yourself as somebody
that you're not with the intent to
deceive in any way for any purpose that
that is considered online prod and then
finally intellectual property is at risk
via or because of digital marketing or
digital media opportunities so we know
probably all of us know a lot about
pirating of software pirating and video
games and music it's a big deal with
respect to the internet and so as with
any major shift in technology we're
still grappling with how to get our arms
around what the rules should be
regarding all of these things privacy
and online fraud and protecting
intellectual property so those I think
will continue to be issues for the near
future at least but a huge opportunity
and some some risks that go with it but
an exciting area definitely so that's
all for today for chapter 10 let me know
if you have any questions and have a
good rest of your week bye

## Chapter 11
 Good afternoon.
Today we're going to be talking about product concepts, which is the content for Chapter
11.
We've covered quite a few general topics, and so going forward now, we're going to be
kicking into more specifics related to the four P's.
This chapter, Chapter 11, kind of starts that process with product.
First of all, I believe we've already discussed this, but what exactly is a product?
A product could be a physical tangible product, actual physical something, a good, or it could
be a service, which is where you are applying human or mechanical force to something to
provide a service to somebody.
It could even be an idea or a concept.
We can categorize products into consumer products or business products.
Of course, we'll further categorize those.
Consumer products are categorized generally based on how much effort goes into shopping
for them.
A convenience product is something that you put very little thought to.
It could be a pack of gum.
It could be something that you just always buy the same brand, the same laundry soap,
for example, so you don't think about it.
It's just convenient. You pick it up and you go.
A shopping product, on the other hand, is something that you really are comparing features
between different competing brands or product types.
A specialty product requires quite a little bit of shopping effort, and in particular
with the specialty product, these tend to be high-end sorts of products like a Rolex
watch, Gucci handbag, and the distribution for these products tends to be very selective.
So they're not widely available, and so you are really going out of your way to obtain
a specialty product.
An unsought product, finally, is a product that you really don't seek out.
It could be life insurance or an ambulance service, something that you may need at some
point, but it's not something you typically think about shopping for.
Business products, on the other hand, there are seven categories that we'll talk about
briefly.
An installation business product is where you would go into a customer site and install
something; a building, a computer system, a process control system, something like that.
Typically high dollar, kind of an elaborate sort of maybe a construction project; you
can think of it like that.
Accessory equipment: this is equipment that you need in your business but they are ancillary
really to your core product.
You could think of it as some toner for computers, that kind of thing.
You'll use it on your business but it's not part of the product that gets manufactured.
Raw materials, component parts, and process materials are items that do roll into a manufactured
product.
So raw materials tend to be commodity sorts of products like, it could be corn kernels,
sugar, wood, that kind of thing.
Component parts are pieces of equipment that you would install into a product.
It could be a gear in a motor or a tire, that kind of thing, a radio system that goes into
a car, something like that.
Process materials could be something like an ingredient that goes into packaged food
product or a sauce.
Salad dressing, for example, something like that.
MRO supplies, maintenance, repair and I believe it's operations supply, these are things you
use in your business to keep everything running and working.
It could be paper products.
It could be something you use to repair and maintain equipment.
You need them but they are not part of the product that you manufacture.
Then, finally, business services.
These are services that you would provide to a business customer.
It could be legal services, accounting services, advertising, that kind of thing.
All right, so let's talk about the concept of product line versus product mix.
When you talk about a company's product line, you're referring to all the different sorts
of products that they provide.
So Campbell's Soup, for example, they provide soups and sauces, frozen meals, beverages
and biscuits.
Each of those would be considered a separate product line.
Together, they make up Campbell's product mix.
So the number of different product lines, the more product lines that you have, that
a company has, the wider their product mix is.
The more products in a line, so take the average number of products in a product line in the
company's … across all of their product lines, that describes the depth of their product
mix.
You'll use those terms and they are important to know.
We'll talk more about them.
Let's change gears a little bit and talk about the product life cycle.
The product life cycle is a concept that it's …. How do I want to say it?
It's a guideline.
It's not a hard and fast break between categories but it does help people to understand where you're
at with the product.
So every product has to be created and then it's launched in the market, and then its
sails and profits grow, and then they steady off, and then they start to decline.
If you can get a picture of where a product is in that process, you know something about
what's going on as far as managing that product.
Introduction in that phase of the product life cycle, you're just launching the product.
It's very expensive.
You're putting a lot of money into making consumers aware of what you've got to offer.
Profits at this point typically are negative, actually.
You're just getting the word out about your product.
During the growth period, in this phase, your sales are growing rapidly and your profits
will actually reach their peak in this phase.
Here is where you, towards the end of the growth phase you'll start to see competition
come in, and that's where your profits start to fall because you need to start being more
price competitive with your product.
When you see that profits are dropping there, then you really are moving more into the maturity
phase.
In the maturity phase, here you have a lot of product competition happening, fierce competition
typically.
Your profits continue to fall and there's a point in there where your sales will peak
and then start to fall.
That marks the transition between maturity and decline.
When you get into the decline phase, here, your sales are dropping, your profits continue
to drop, and there may be a point there where you have to decide this is a product that
you want to keep making available on the market.
Those are the four phases of the product life cycle.
Let's say that you have introduced a new product and you are trying to get it into the growth
phase of the product life cycle and really get consumers to be aware of your product.
So there are steps in that process that consumers will go through.
First of all, you need to make them even aware of your product and then you want them to
be interested in your product, then you want them to include your product in their evaluation
of product options.
Then the next step is to get them to try your product and finally, hopefully, they will
adopt your product and buy it and then re-buy it repeatedly.
When you are launching a new product, you're trying really hard to get to the innovator
and the early adopter groups of consumers.
These are consumers that are open to new products.
Innovators are the first people to try a new product.
Early adopter is right up there with them.
They're adopting new products before most people do, so they are more open to them.
As a marketer, if you can locate those people and get them to try your product, you're moving
along that road to making consumers, in general, aware of what you have to offer.
Early majority, these are moving more into the masses of consumers.
Late majority, here you're talking about people that are latecomers, obviously.
They're not interested in new things.
Then, finally, laggards.
These are people that may not adopt a new product until there's even a newer one available.
They're really at the tail-end of the adoption groups.
All right, so let's talk about branding.
Branding is huge.
The value of a brand for a company can be incredible.
Think, for example, of Nike or Sony.
When you say those names, you have a mental picture of what that brand is like and that
quality that it represents.
That value is important and consumers will actually pay higher price in order to have
that name, in order to purchase that name.
So that's one of the reasons why branding is so important, is because it helps a company
to differentiate its products from other products, and hopefully in a good way.
If you can achieve that differentiation in the marketplace, its helping you to secure
repeat business from consumers and it will also help you when you launch a new product
if you can leverage that strong brand name.
A brand is just anything that identifies a product.
It could be a symbol.
It could be a name.
It could be a jingle, anything that consumers associate with that product.
So the brand name is something that you can say.
That's different from a brand mark, which also might be a symbol of some kind.
The trademark is a legal distinction that gives a company the exclusive rights to use
a brand name or a brand mark.
The trade name is actually the company, the official name of the company leveraging a
brand or a trademark.
Brand equity is the value that can be developed along with the brand.
With brand equity comes brand loyalty where consumers want to stick with the same brand.
They recognize the brand.
They prefer the brand.
Finally, brand insistence is where consumers will only purchase a particular brand.
So there's a lot of strategy that goes in with branding.
As a company, when you're releasing new products, you have to decide, "Are you going to label
this product on its own?
Are you going to tie it in with a family branding, sort of a naming convention?"
You can think about Kellogg's cereals or you can think about different kinds of laundry
soaps. Procter & Gamble, I believe, makes Gain and Tide and different ones.
They don't attach their Procter & Gamble name to that.
In that case, that's an individual branding sort of a scenario versus different brands
of Doritos chips or Lays chips or Kellogg's cereals.
Those kind of things are more of a family branding approach.
If you are going to release a brand extension now, you're talking about a product line and
you are going to release a new product that uses the brand name as a prior product but
it's still a little bit of a different product.
You can think about improvements to existing products that are released under the same name.
I'm trying to think of a good example and I don't have one coming to me, but anyway.
Co-branding then, on the other hand, is when two companies, two manufacturers or two brands,
both will print their name on a product or associate it with a product.
For example, the one I always think about is Shiner beer and Jack Daniel's.
You can get a bottle of Shiner's beer and they put a … No, I'm thinking of the wrong
one.
Shiner's beer with a barbecue sauce, I believe, is what it is.
You can get Shiner beer with a recipe on it that uses a particular brand of barbecue sauce,
maybe Heinz or something like that.
That would be a co-branding example.
Brand licensing, this is where you authorize somebody else to use your brand, and so you'll
get some sort of a royalty fee from that.
All right, so we've talked a lot about a number of different things: product life cycle, branding,
getting new products adopted.
With all of those things, there is strategy that goes with them.
In order to really present your product to the market in a strategic way, you're going
to have to be considering the packaging and the labeling.
That's what consumers are seeing.
You may choose one of a number of different strategic approaches when you go about thinking
or deciding how to design your packaging and your labeling.
You may want your product to really be different from other products on the market or it may
need to be consistent with others on the market to really make it acceptable to consumers.
You may choose to create packaging that gives consumers a secondary use for the product.
So maybe you sell something in a tub that can be used later with the lid or something
like that.
You may choose to bundle multiple units together in the same package to try to encourage repeat
use of a product, that sort of thing, or to bundle it with another product that consumers
might be attracted to.
You may also be thinking about your distribution channel and ways of packaging that would be
attractive to distributors, which may actually help you get product into stores if your distributors
are happy with the way some things stacks or it can easily be moved around a warehouse,
that kind of thing.
You'll decide what you want to do and where you want to be strategically there, and then
you've got to be thinking about how much it cost, what sort of promotion you want to be
able to do, what your resellers need.
Can you get some consistency in how you package with other products in your line or is that
even important?
Do you want some kind of tamper resistant sort of a capability to your packaging and
do you need to be concerned I think environmental amount of plastic in the packaging, for example,
or the biodegradability of however you package your product, those sorts of things.
Then based on all of that, then you are designing a package that will protect your product,
that's a big one, be convenient for consumers and for your resellers, and also that will
communicate and promote your product with the message that you want to deliver to consumers.
All of that, that's a lot of information all related to product and it all truly is quite
important and relevant and something that is top of mind for people that are managing
products and developing new products.
That is it for Chapter 11.
Do let me know if you have questions and I will be back to talk about Chapter 12.
Thanks. Have a good day.

## Chapter 12
 Hello.
Today, we're talking about Chapter 12, which is honing in really, on more of a product
aspect, I suppose you could say, or process, specific to developing and managing products.
We got a lot of terms thrown at you in Chapter 11, and so now we're going to talk more about
really actually managing products.
For marketers, really you can think of the holy grail for marketers as being the ability
to maintain a competitive advantage.
To that end, really it's always a moving target with products that you're bringing to market.
You want to have something new.
You want to have something current.
There's two ways that you can go about making that happen.
You can either be working with your existing products, and tweaking them to the latest
customer demands or technology, or you can develop new products.
That's what we're going to be talking about today, those two ways to try to secure a competitive
advantage.
With respect to managing existing products, here you can either extend your line, or a
line, a product line, with a new product in the same category, or you can modify a product
in some way.
If you're going to modify a product here, you're looking to increase the quality, which
would be to make the product in some way more reliable or more durable, perhaps.
Or you can add features to a product and that way enhance its functionality, or you can
change the look of it.
Something about the product that appeals to the senses is what aesthetic changes are all
about.
Does it need to smell different?
Does it need to taste different?
Does it feel different?
Does it look different?
That kind of thing.
If you're managing existing products, those really are your choices.
Everything you do with an existing product will fall into one of those buckets.
When it comes to new products now, there's a quite extensive, and ... This can be a long
process to develop and release a new product to the market.
In this case then, you first have to find an idea.
Those can come from customers, from competitors, from inside your own company.
There are some creative ways to go about seeking out those sorts of ideas.
You see a lot of that happening now with businesses online and that kind of thing, getting feedback
from customers.
All of that's very important and helps to feed the product development process for companies.
Once you've got a pool of ideas, you would need to screen them according to your company
objectives, your goals, which ones fit best with who you are as a company, and where you
want to be going.
If you've done that, then generally you'll then release an idea back to the consumers
in some way to test their fondness for your new product ideas, because remember too, as
a company you have limited resources.
You're going to have to decide, which new product ideas that you'll pursue, and which
ones you won't.
A good way to get your arms around that, to start with anyway, is to take them to the
customers and see which ones they like the best.
Once you know what consumers are liking, then you can start to analyze the profitability
of a potential idea, what the market might be able to offer in terms of sales opportunity,
that kind of thing.
What are the costs going to be around a new product concept bringing it to market?
That all rolls into business analysis.
The next step then is to actually develop a prototype and put something together.
That's complicated, because you really do have to figure out what collection of features
you're going to bring together into a product, and build an actual sample product that you
can take back to customers in the test marketing phase.
See what they think, and get their feedback.
Once you've done that process and really fine-tuned what you have to offer, then you release it
to the market.
That's its own significant process to organize your distribution channel, organize your manufacturing.
Make sure you have the manufacturing capacity.
Get your sales force up to speed.
Get your promotion activities, all of that, lined out and planned.
And have an implementation timetable for making everything happen.
That's it.
All of this is, like I said, it can be years before you would be able to actually develop
and release a new product.
The name of the game, as I was saying, is to find a way to be different and special
compared to the competition.
You're trying to get consumers to think of you as special in some way and different from
competitors, but in a good way.
You can do that by addressing quality issues.
Do you have a high level of quality in the consumer's mind?
That relates somewhat to what they're expecting from you and your products.
It's a little bit subjective and hard sometimes to get your arms around, but you want to be
thought of as a quality product, and you want to be a company that consistently provides
a good product.
They can think about this with respect to service industries, too.
If you sometimes get a good haircut, maybe that's not good enough, and so you want to
go to a hairdresser that always gives you a good haircut.
Speaking maybe more to women here, but if you've ever gone and had your hair colored
and came out sort of green, you're not going to be happy with that level of quality.
That's just one example.
You can try to be different from competitors by having higher quality, more consistent
quality.
Number two, you can work on your product features, and your design.
Maybe your styling, the styling of your product, is special in some way.
I think of IKEA with respect to that.
They have some really clever product features and product ideas that you can see there.
I'm not convinced that their quality is always great, but they have really fun ideas, so
unique in that way.
Finally, a product is not necessarily just one product.
You have what you would consider a core product, the actual meat of what your product is, but
sometimes there's things that go with that.
It could be technical support, or an online reference book, or something like that.
You sometimes will have ancillary or accompanying sorts of products that go with your core product.
Sometimes those services are quite valuable to customers.
If you're needing to assemble a product, and the instructions are in Chinese, for example,
you might really appreciate having a service that you can call to get instructions that
you can actually read, that sort of thing.
Okay, let's shift gears a little bit and talk about product positioning.
With respect to differentiating a product, in the end, you have a consumer base that
has a mental picture of your product compared to other competitor products.
You can think about organizing all the competitor products in a playing field and seeing how
your product would be positioned compared to a competitor product on two dimensions.
With this particular perceptual map, the bases that are being considered here are prestige,
ownership prestige, and financial effectiveness on this line here.
I'm not sure what that means, but I think maybe bang for the buck, if I were to interpret
it.
In this table, Mercedes is considered the most prestigious to own, right up there with
Jaguar, very close.
But Mercedes is considered by consumers to be more financially effective, or better bang
for the buck.
Maybe they think Jaguar's overpriced for what you're getting.
On the other hand down here, Volvo is not as prestigious, but it is pretty financially
effective.
If you are a marketer looking at this sort of map, which really has strong statistical
bases for plotting these different positions here.
If you're looking at this, you can think about where you might want to be in this market
and then start to think about promoting your product in a way that might move your position
into a place where there could be some good opportunity.
That's how marketers use that.
Along that line, you may choose to try to reposition a product.
Sometimes, if you just tweak the price, or a couple of features, depending on the bases
that you're looking at a perceptual map with, you can really put your product in a more
advantageous position with respect to competitor products on the market.
That would be considered repositioning.
Finally, here, one short point.
There may be a point where you need to take a product out of your product line, or out
of your product mix.
That's not a small decision.
With that goes ancillary products.
You got resellers to consider.
You got manufacturing capacity that's involved.
You may have support needs that go along with the product that you can't just stop supporting
a product for your consumer base without injuring your reputation.
These are big decisions that get made, and the marketers involved are the ones that are
making these decisions, at least in collaboration with executive management.
There are a lot of decisions to go with all of this product related area.
Your company may be organized with product managers who are responsible for a particular
product or product line.
You may have a company that works with brand managers, so a particular brand is represented
by its own manager, so Tide versus Gain laundry soap.
Market managers are working more with the customers and organizing activities, interacting
with the customers or involving certain customer bases.
And then a venture team, this is a group of people representing cross-functional departments
in a company that are looking to bring a new product to market.
Let's see, I think that's it for Chapter 12.
Again, there's a lot of terms in here, very dynamic and important part of what companies
do to stay relevant in the minds of consumers.
That wraps it up for Chapter 12.
Let me know if you have questions, and we will be talking more soon.
Thanks.
Bye.

# Chapter 14
 Good afternoon.
We are talking today about supply chains and marketing channels.
That is the content for chapter 14.
So when we talk about a supply chain, we are referring to all of the players that are involved
with bringing a product to market, from the companies that you may source raw materials
from to people, companies, involved in manufacturing process to resale organizations to the customers
that purchase the products, even the FedEx trucks that deliver product to the stores,
and all of the vendors that you may use to source component parts for the products.
There are a lot of moving parts potentially to a supply chain and effectively managing
all of those pieces can be fairly involved.
It's quite important.
So, so we're just going to be jumping into that topic today and starting to talk about some of the
issues that are involved there.
So when you think about supply chain management, there are some components that you can wrap
your arms around or wrap your brain around that are somewhat different.
So operations management has to do with transforming the product from a raw material sort of a
state to a final good or a finished good state.
Here we're talking more about manufacturing sorts of processes, that part of the process.
Supply management has to do more with the input, so dealing more with vendors, purchasing
contracts, sourcing product, that kind of thing.
The logistics management has to do with managing the flow of product from where you're originally
sourcing all of the inputs all the way through to the customer.
There are a lot of pieces there too that we'll get to later in our conversation.
Finally, channel management is really honing in on the relationships of all the different
players involved.
These are partners to you in your company.
To the extent that you can build good relationships with them, you're going to be more effective
in managing that supply chain, which should impact your ability to be competitive in the
market, as we'll see.
Sometimes people tend to think that if you can buy product directly from the manufacturer
that you are going to be getting a better deal and sometimes that's true, but really
not all the time.
As it happens, intermediaries in the supply chain really do add a lot of value.
In the textbook, the book will refer to intermediaries creating utility and different forms of utility,
so time utility, place utility, possession utility, and form utility.
You can look more in the book to learn more about these but in a nutshell, the intermediaries
in a supply chain are able to collect all of the varieties and assortments of products
that consumers want and warehouse them and make them available to consumers when they
want them and where they want to buy them.
Manufacturers really can't do that.
Even just think about a company like Best Buy which sources televisions, cellphones,
computers, CDs, speakers.
All those different products they can make available in one place and they source them
from all the different manufacturers in all of the different varieties, in all the different
colors, in all the different sizes that consumers might potentially want.
Rather than having to go to multiple different manufacturers for products, you can just go
to Best Buy and find everything you need.
That makes it much more convenient for the consumer.
And because the Best Buy store can buy in bulk, they can also purchase product at a lower
price because they're ordering in larger quantities.
Even there, they can pass on a lower price to the consumer many times.
Intermediaries perform a lot of facilitation kinds of functions as far as helping the exchange
to happen with customers.
Just to kind of give you a laundry list of some of the things that they do, they are
often times much more connected to the customer than the manufacturers are so they're in a
great position to collect market data and analyze data, understand the target audience,
communicate with customers with respect to sales promotions and actually selling the
products to consumers.
They are managing inventories.
They're coordinating movement of the product from warehouses to stores.
They're providing customer support, technical support, financing in many cases.
They just do a lot and they add a lot of value that we don't always recognize, I don't think.
Let's look at what types of channels actually exist in the market.
For consumer products, if you are buying directly from a manufacturer, we're looking here at
this channel A sort of a scenario.
Directly from the producer to the consumer.
Well, you might have that happen if you're buying online, for example, or if you're going
directly to a producer's company-owned store.
I like to buy Hanna Andersson clothes for my grandkids and they do have a Hanna Andersson
store in Portland, Oregon.
That would be a direct purchase.
I can also buy directly from them online.
I don't know that they actually sell their product anywhere else so they are a case where
they're just selling directly to consumers.
If manufacturers are selling to a reseller store who then sells to the consumers, that's
an example of this scenario B here in this chart.
Often times though consumer products are sold to distributors who buy them in very large
bulk.
The distributors then have their own network of resellers who then sell to the consumers.
That's this channel C representation here.
Finally with D, here you're looking at involving an agent who actually does not take title
to the product but helps to match up buyers and sellers.
You might see this more with international markets, potentially different kinds of consumer
products you might see them involved here as well.
I would say mostly for consumer products, we're looking at A, B, and C here types of
channels.
Turning to business products, here, it's a little bit of a different world.
Depending on the nature of the buyer, the buyer may have more or less influence or more
or less buying power to purchase directly from a manufacturer.
If you are a very large organization, say like a Boeing for example, you may be able
to negotiate a purchase directly from a producer of let's say steel or aluminum or some kind
of product that you would have to buy in large quantities.
Because you have a lot of money to bring to the table, manufacturers would be more willing
to work with you directly as a business customer.
That's an example here of this scenario E.
Also like with the consumer markets, you'll see resellers, and they're calling them in this chart,
they're calling them industrial distributors.
They're like resellers or distributors that are taking title to the product and then in
turn reselling them to business customers.
Agents here are companies that are involved with matching up buyers and sellers.
And the big difference here is that they don't take title to the product.
Agents may in turn sell product to industrial distributors who sell them to resellers.
In both of these cases, G and H, where agents are involved, the agents are being paid on
a commission basis.
Again, they're not taking title to the product.
If you are a manufacturer and you're trying to decide which sort of a channel structure
to build for your company, how do you go about doing that?
Well, it just depends and it depends on quite a few things.
It depends on the nature of the intermediary partners that you have to pick from, what
they do, what their capabilities are, how the industry is set up.
Are intermediaries involved in that industry or does that industry tend to sell directly
to customers?
What are the competitor companies doing?
You may need to match what they're doing in that particular industry.
What are your customers like?
If they're large companies with lots of buying power, you're more likely to be selling directly
to them.
What is the nature of the product that you're selling?
If it's more complicated, larger dollar, more expensive, you're more likely to sell directly
to that customer because you need to be involved to accurately communicate the benefits of
the product and answer all of the customer's questions.
What type of organization are you and what type of organization is your customer, your potential customer?
Again, if you are dealing with a large company with lots of buying power, you'll be more
likely to deal directly with them.
Also as always, the marketing forces, environmental forces, will play in here.
Technology has impacted how our channels operate.
We have more online shopping now
that never even used to exist.
Things like that will have an impact.
What's the economy like?
Do we need to have more brick and mortar stores, more reseller stores, because of an economic
condition that's making it harder for manufacturers to have their own stores because of the overhead
involved?
That kind of thing.
It just really depends and it is a very big decision with a big impact.
Alright, so in terms of being strategic with your channel management, I'll just mention a few things
here.
The book covers them in more detail.
You will have to think about how much coverage of the market you want.
If you have a convenient sort of product, you're likely going to want some intensive
market coverage, so lots of locations where customers can buy your product.
If you have more of a shopping good, you'll want fewer reseller locations but of a different
nature and slightly higher quality, a little more customer attention, that kind of thing.
If you have an exclusive good to sell like a Gucci handbag, for example, you're going
to be looking more for a smaller number of distribution outlets and you're going to be
pretty selective about which ones you choose.
It just depends on how much coverage in the market you're looking for.
You do need to be sensitive to what the competition is doing.
You are looking for a competitive advantage.
The distribution channel is, in my opinion, somewhat untapped as a potential source of
competitive advantage.
I'll give you an example of that here in a minute.
Then also when you're dealing with your channel partners, there's a lot of relationships involved
and a lot of players.
Some players in the chain will have more power than others.
Think about Coca-Cola for example.
They likely have a lot of sway over what the resellers in their chain are able to demand.
In another scenario, the bottling company or one of the intermediaries may have more
sway on the manufacturer to dictate the terms of that relationship because the manufacturer's
in a more vulnerable position for some reason.
Channel power is an issue and it contributes to channel leadership.
You want all the players in your supply chain to be cooperating with one another and play
nice because the success of one impacts the success of the others.
The ability of one to do their part in the chain properly and effectively impacts the
ability of the other players in the chain to do their part well.
If you can build a good team here, that's a big deal.
Channel conflict will happen or can happen if you're not very careful.
I'm going to go back to this slide here.
If you are the manufacturer of a product and you have multiple industrial distributors
in the United States, each of them may have their own geographic territory that they cover.
If you are not pricing your product the same to each of these industrial distributors,
they're likely to be upset with you, the ones that are getting a higher price.
You have to be very deliberate about setting up your distribution channel so that you're
limiting the amount of channel conflict that would potentially be happening.
The price that you give the industrial distributor is going to impact the price at which the
industrial distributor gives to customers.
If the customers can get the same product for a lower price from another distributor,
they're going to go there instead of to this distributor and that's going to make this
distributor here quite unhappy.
That's the sort of thing we're talking about with channel conflict.
Channel integration has to do with the management of the different players in a supply chain.
If you are a vertically integrated sort of a supply chain, you have the management for
the different players in the chain going vertically under single management.
Some particular central party is managing this supply and the manufacturing and the
reselling.
All of those different steps in the process would be managed by one source with a vertical
integration sort of an approach.
With a horizontal integration approach, here you're talking about all of the manufacturers
of your product at different locations being managed by the same arm.
Every part in the chain that's at the same level is managed under a common management.
Hopefully that makes sense.
Okay, so, moving on.
Let's talk about logistics management.
This is one arm of supply chain management that has to do with the flow of the physical
product as it transforms from a raw material to a finished good.
Here, we're talking about managing order processing, managing inventory, managing materials, and
how they are introduced and kept and used in the manufacturing process, warehousing
the finished goods, and finally, transporting goods, not only finished goods, but also raw
materials into manufacturing facilities.
All of those pieces lend themselves to a more efficient operation if you do them well, which
can impact your strategic advantage or your competitive position significantly.
I was going to tell you a story back here.
I don't know if we can push this back, but I just want to give you an example.
I worked for a company that made barcode readers for about seven years.
When I started working with them, they sold directly to end user customers one or two
barcode readers at a time.
Their strategic decision about distribution was to build a distributor network that they
would sell to and let the distributors then sell to the end users.
Over the course of about three years, they made this change.
It increased their profits tremendously because we were able to actually reach out to so many
more customers.
Our tech support department then was only supporting a handful of distributors around
the country and resellers, I guess, too.
We probably had 200 customers instead of 5,000 customers when we made this change.
It made everything about the company more efficient.
Every time we sold to a reseller distributor, we were selling much larger quantities.
They in turn were more local to the customers and could support them better than we could
as a manufacturer across the country.
That's just an example of a very impactful, strategic decision related to distribution.
Anyway, it is very important for companies to get this right.
Alright so finally, let's turn to legal issues related to supply chain management.
The name of the game here is that our federal laws want us to be a country where there is
healthy competition between companies.
And so to the extent that you are doing anything that's going to limit competition, you may
be under some scrutiny.
Duel distribution is the situation where you're using more than one channel to distribute
your products.
Where you might get in trouble here is if you're selling directly to end user customers
in a way that makes it difficult for your resellers to compete.
That's the first area.
Restricted sales territories.
This has to do with manufacturers giving one reseller or distributor a geographic territory
to call their own and another reseller distributor a different geographic territory to call their
own.
In general, this is a very accepted practice, but it something that the government can look
at on a case by case basis.
If you are a company that is selling only one product line and competing against another
reseller in the same area who sells a different product line, having restricted sales territories
can actually enhance competition and so that is viewed favorably.
Tying agreements happen when you as a manufacturer tie the distribution of one product to the
distribution of another.
Where you'll see this come up is if you have one product category that you manufacture
that isn't selling very well, you may try to tie it to the sales of another product
to get it moving in the market.
This is not considered anti-competitive if there is a supplier that is providing products
of a certain quality and if this supplier is the only company that can do that and if
the intermediary is able to carry competing products and finally if there's a company
that's just entering the market, this tends to be accepted.
Exclusive dealings have to do with a manufacturer requiring a reseller to sell only their product
and not another competing brand.
If you are making this requirement of your resellers and you're blocking competitors
from as much as 15% of the market and if you have a large sales volume and if you are considerably
larger than your reseller, you have to be careful because this may be considered anti-competitive
and you may come under some federal scrutiny for that.
Finally, if you are refusing to deal with resellers or distributors just because they
are not complying with or willing to comply with your anti-competitive policies, that
will get you into trouble as well.
That buttons up our conversation for chapter 14.
Do let me know if you have questions and I will be back soon with chapter 16 video for
you.
Thanks.
Bye.

## Chamber 16
 Hello.
We're talking today about chapter 16 which has to do with integrative marketing communications.
As a marketer you are communicating with customers a lot and in a lot of different ways.
The idea, here, is that you want to coordinate all of those efforts in order to optimize
the impact and the persuasive ability or influence that you can have on customers to actually
purchase your product.
That's integrative marketing communications in a nutshell.
Let's talk about communication, because really when you're talking about promoting a product,
you are talking about figuring out how best to communicate with your customers.
It's not a simple thing.
Let's say you are trying to sell shaving cream to your target market of men.
You could have an advertisement that just says, "Please buy our shaving cream, because
it's the best."
But that's really not what happens right?
If you're going to try to sell shaving cream, you may have a print advertisement in a magazine,
you may a television advertisement commercial, you may have sales coupons that you try to
get in the hands of men to encourage them to buy your sorts of shaving cream product.
All of these various efforts that you come up with are trying to deliver a message to
these men of some kind, a message of some kind that communicates something to them that
your product is a good shave cream, that it leaves them with smooth skin, that it smells
good, that it's a good value.
You have to decide on what your message is.
The point here is, is that the way you try to communicate that is going to be created
by you as a marketer in some sort of a fashion that you could call coded in a way.
You are the source.
You are delivering this message, but it's delivered in a coded way.
You are encoding your meaning in these various advertising methods, and you're putting them
out into a communication channel via television, via magazine, via coupon, and you're hoping
that your target market is going to receive your message and decode it in the way that
you intended.
That's a tricky business to be able to get them to understand what you're trying to communicate
as a marketer.
All the while, there's lots of things that are happening at the same time for that man,
customer, potential customer, that may impact the way you receive your message.
We call that noise.
You, as a marketer, are trying to find the best way to communicate, the best way to deliver
message that will be clear even in the presence of a noisy world that's going to impact your
target market's ability to receive your message.
It's fairly complicated right?
Promotion, I'll just read you the textbook definition.
It builds and maintains favorable relationships by informing and persuading one or more audiences
to view an organization positively and accept its products.
What does that mean?
There's a lot in there.
Ok so you, as a marketer, promote in order to create awareness, in order to stimulate demand, to
encourage product trial, to identify prospects that may want to purchase your product, to
develop loyalty among customers, to support your reseller network, to fight off whatever
the competitors are doing at the same time, and to try to level out your sales over the
months so that you don't have great big swings in demand.
That makes you less efficient as a company, as a producer, if you have to increase your
production and then decrease it depending on the seasons or whatever's causing the fluctuation.
Promotion is quite important, and it has some pretty hefty goals here.
We promote in four major sorts of categories: via advertising, via personal selling, via
public relations, and via sales promotion.
The combination of these that you will use is considered your promotion mix.
The combination that you pick will depend on a lot of things.
I've got a list, here: What are your resources as a company?
What are your objectives and your policies as a company?
Who's your target market?
What's the nature of the product that you're trying to sell?
What is the cost of the different options, the different promotion options, and are they
available to reach the market that you need to reach?
Finally, are you looking to employ a push or a pull sort of a strategy?
For example, let's say that you are a manufacturer of shampoo.
You may promote directly to women to try to buy your shampoo, not to the stores that sell
the shampoo to the women.
That would be a pull philosophy where you're appealing to the ultimate consumer who will
then look for your product in the stores and try to pull that product through the channel
that way.
You're dealing with a shampoo product and women, and maybe your target market watches
a lot of TV.
You may choose television advertisements over something like door to door salesmen of shampoo.
There we've had some conversation about the target market, the product, and the availability
of the different promotional media, or promotional options, and also the push/pull channel philosophies
that will impact that decision.
Contrast that to Caterpillar company that sells industrial farming sorts of equipment.
They have big pieces of equipment.
They're expensive and they're complicated.
Here, you may have select number of resellers that you need to work personally with.
You're selling directly, personal selling, to those selectively chosen reseller organizations.
You're going to have a lot of training to do with them, and you're going to be educating
your resellers in order to push the product through the market that way.
Because the Caterpillar resellers know their customers, they can convince their customers
to buy Caterpillar products if they're convinced it's the best option for them.
Definitely a different promotion mix depending on the circumstances.
Word of mouth is important always because people trust what other people are telling
them, if they trust those people.
We know this.
We may ask our friends, "Where do you get your, um, your hair cut, because I really
like your haircut."
"Oh, my hairdresser is great."
So we go to that person to cut our hair because we've been told by a friend that they do a
good job, and we can see that too.
Word of mouth is very important.
As we become a more electronic world and the internet is more of a function, some of this
word of mouth is happening, now, online with product reviews.
You'll see buzz marketing campaigns going on online.
It's kind of like word of mouth, but electronically.
Also, viral marketing is happening.
Look in your book and see a little bit more about what those are.
Product placement.
I've seen this categorized as advertising.
I've seen it categorized as public relations.
But basically, here, you're putting your product into another entertainment media.
Maybe you're Coca-Cola and you can get your Coke product into a movie shoot where everybody
in the world that watches that movie is going to see Coke products.
Very great way to advertise or promote your product if you can make that happen.
Let's step back, here, just a little bit and talk about whether or not we think promotion
is good or bad.
Some people say promotion creates need where there really isn't any, and so in that way
it's a little bit manipulative and deceptive.
Some people say that we need promotion because it stimulates the economy, and promotes business,
and a lifestyle in our country that's worth having.
Really, I guess, there's probably some of each of that.
In the end, if you are an ethical marketer and trying to run your marketing operations
on an ethical platform, you'll do yourself a lot of good as a company to avoid a lot
of those criticisms.
But I'll let you read some of those in the chapter and come to your own conclusions.
Mine is, "Do the right thing," and that helps.
That always helps.
On my little soapbox for a minute there.
With those little pearls of wisdom, I'll close today.
I'll be back next time to talk about chapter 17.
Enjoy the rest of your day.
Bye-bye.

## Chapter 17
 Good afternoon, hi we are talking today
about chapter 17. Now if you will recall
from chapter 16 which was all about
integrated marketing communications
there are four elements to the promotion
mix that marketers can choose from. And
chapter 17 actually hones in on two of
those. So today we're going to be talking
about advertising and public relations.
Okay, so advertising is is a major of
course, a major way that marketers
communicate with their target audience.
And with advertising you are actually
paying for the communication that you
are putting together and it's non
personal in other words it's not
face-to-face selling, personal selling so
it's non personal and you're directing
your communication through some kind of
a media like television, magazines, radio,
billboards, the internet. There's many
different kinds and some of them are
listed here on the screen. So at that is
what advertising is. I apologize but there
are a lot of terms in this chapter and
so I'm just going to kind of fly through
those real quick. Most of these are
pretty intuitive. Okay, so the first one
is institutional advertising and this is
advertising that is geared to
communicate something about the
organization itself. So it tries to
promote an image of a company, maybe a
philosophy of a company, maybe even a
political position that the company
takes.
So that's institutional advertising.
Advocacy advertising is when a company
chooses to advertise for a particular
cause, okay. So if you are a company
that's quite engaged with social
responsibility concerns you might see a
fair amount of this. Product advertising
is focused on the features uses benefits
of a product, an actual product which is
different from Pioneer advertising which
is looking to promote a whole brand or a
whole, I'm sorry, a whole product category
not a brand but a whole product category.
Okay and then competitive advertising, in
this case you really are looking to
promote a certain brand. And that's a
little different from comparative
advertising which is actually now
comparing your product to a competitor
product. In competitive advertising you
may be actually pulling in conversation
about competitor products as well but
your focus is more on a particular brand;
where in comparative advertising there
you really are saying look at our brand
compared to this brand. Look at our, look
at our, Tide laundry soap compared to
Gain laundry soap. We get, we get stains
out so much better; that kind of thing.
And okay, so reminder advertising this is
the case where you need to remind your
target audience about something; features
of the product, ways that you can use it.
One of my favorites here was um, had to do
with Arm and Hammer baking soda where I
don't remember exactly when it was but
they had some television advertisements
that came out to just remind people that
you could use Arm and Hammer to help you
make your drain not stink, or your
refrigerator smell pretty, or you can add
it to your laundry. Those are just
reminders sorts of advertising. Okay and
finally reinforcement advertising. This
is the case where you're looking to
assure the target market that they have
really made it the best choice and so
you're giving them strokes in a way to
say you've made a good decision by
choosing our products and here's why.
Okay so lots of terms there but they
pretty much are intuitive so hopefully
that won't be an issue. Alright so,
let's say that you are going to put
together an advertising campaign, you've
decided that you need to to do some
advertising, there's a lot of pieces to
that puzzle and so we're just going to
walk through those real quick. So first
of all, you need to be super clear about
who your target audience is, and where
you're going to find them, who they are
so you'll be interested in knowing
democrat demographic qualities of that
market. And you do have to know actually
physically where to find them because
if they are mostly on the East Coast then
you're looking to advertising media and
opportunities that that go there, that
that are there that you can purchase in
that area to reach those people. So it's
very specific, it will be very specific
to where your target market actually is
and who they are. Alright so then you
need to define your objectives. So what
exactly are you hoping to do with this
advertisement. Make yourself be specific
with that. Are you looking to increase
sales? Are you looking to increase market
share? Are you looking to introduce a new
product and make people aware of a
certain particular feature? You need to
know exactly what, what your goals are
there and then based on that what are
your, what are your primary selling
points or your basic points that you
need to communicate in this advertising
campaign? Okay, what do you have to play
with with respect to money? What's your
funding? And this can be based on just an
executive decision on we're going to
spend this much or you could be looking
at an advertising amount based on a
percent of your sales or you could set
objectives and then base your spending
on what you think it will cost to meet
those objectives or you could be looking
at what competitors are doing and
determining to match what your
competitors are doing with respect to
advertising. So there's different basis
to make to to use to determine your
funding amount, okay. Alright, so from
there now you know who are you going to
target, what your goal is, what your
selling points are going to be, and now
you've got a budget. Okay, so now you've
got to get a little more specific.
Which media are you going to use?
Television, billboards, the internet, all
of those different options are open to
you and so you have to decide which ones
to choose and so how do you make that
decision. So you may look at the reach of
the media; how many people in your target
audience does this particular avenue
have the capability of actually reaching,
what is the frequency with which the
media is capable of reaching your target
audience and how often do you want to
employ that to reach them, of course
what's the cost. But they have specific
cost per contact kinds of criteria that
different media will be able to tell you
about so you can look at that too. So
once you've decided the media now you're
crafting the message and here we're
talking about the verbiage in the, the
communication, the artwork and and so
depending on who you're talking to and
what your objectives is what your obj
objectives are that that message can be
quite different. If your message is going
to men versus women you're going to use
different words. Some words work
better than others and different
graphics work better with women than men.
Children you would approach a different
way than teenagers than the senior
citizens. So again, you've got to be
clear about who your target audience is
and what you're trying to communicate.
And thinking back to chapter 16 remember
that you are encoding here now your
message and everything about the
crafting of this message is going to
have to be decoded by your target
audience and understand too that
there's noise going on all the time too.
So you may need to you may need to do
some testing of your message to see if
it's getting across the way that you are
intending. Okay so that's complicated so
then the next step you're actually
executing, executing your campaign. You
purchase the media, you've got your
message put together, you put it out
there,
you've got the timetable lined out, and
and then at some point you want to try
to evaluate did it do what it was
supposed to do. So how do you know that?
So if you really want to measure that
you have to do a pretest and a post-test
to to gauge people's recall and
recognition of whatever it is you're
trying to communicate.
Now I said if you really want to do that
of course it depends on what your
objectives are. So if you're hoping to
see a certain sales volume
you can be looking at your saless and
actually see did you meet that and can
you attribute those sales to your
advertising. So that's the sort of
evaluation that marketers try to try to
be able to do. There's a lot of choices
with advertising and people spend a lot
of money on this and so you want to get
the biggest bang for the buck that you
can and so people do get pretty
sophisticated about evaluating what
works best, okay, good.
Alright so let's turn our attention
now to public relations. So public
relations is all about building
relationships with stakeholders. You are
in a competitive market and customers
and consumers are comparing what your
company does to the the competitors out
there and and so it's very important to
have a favorable image with those people
and with all the stakeholders; whether
it's the community, the media, all of your
customer base, your employees, all of
those stakeholders matter. And so
public relations is concerned with, with
all of them. Alright, so what are the
tools of public relations? So publicity
is a news story that comes at no charge
and so if you can get some good free
publicity on your company that can go a
long way to building a positive image of
your company in the minds of the
community and of consumers. News release,
this is a very short, less than 300 words,
one-page sort of a news blast that you
can put out into the media and sometimes
you'll see these in even on online on a
on an Internet kind of a news site that
kind of thing. I used to get them in the
mail from different journal publications
and things like that.
Okay so feature articles, here you're
actually writing an article for a
specific publication and these are
longer, up to 3,000 words and you
you are featuring something in this
article that you're trying to use to
build your image in the community. And
finally a press conference here you are
announcing something major. This is where
you put yourself in front of a camera
and answer questions from the news media
and that kind of thing. Okay, alright so,
how do we know if public relations are
effective? Maybe the biggest thing here
is to do a good job with your
environmental monitoring. So keep your
finger on the pulse of what your
community is thinking about, about your
company and just go ask people and you
know gauge that opinion from the from
the environment that you're concerned
about. Okay so you can also conduct a
public relations audit where you are
actually studying your your image in the
minds of people in the community, you can
do a communications audit, where you're
focused more on the content and
reviewing the material that's going out
into the market, and you can also gauge
what people's impressions of you are as
a socially responsible sort of a company.
So those are the sorts of audits that
public relations people do. Alright
so finally, I don't really know quite how
to approach this but of course we've all
seen negative press happen. This week
here, 2017, we've got a major thing going
on in the news where United Airlines drug
a passenger out of his seat because they
over booked a flight. And so that kind of
negative publicity is is can be quite
detrimental to a company and so the way
that you manage that is really important.
So I guess the first rule is to do
whatever you can to avoid that kind of
negative press. So when we talk about
being in an Internet or a computer age,
boy howdy, information travels and if
somebody's talking badly about your
company it's going to travel and there really
are no secrets. So try not to have that
in the first place but if it does happen
just understand that it's not going
to be possible to maintain a secret and
so be upfront, be truthful,
do your level best to make things right
and and hopefully you can as a company
recover recover from that. But this is
where the infrastructure around what's
acceptable behavior in a company and
what isn't and all of those things are
quite important and maintaining an
ethical marketing sort of a demeanor as
a company can be critical, can be
absolutely critical to the success or
failure of a company. So on that lovely
note we'll close for chapter 17 and I
will be back to discuss our next chapter,
chapter 19. So enjoy the rest of your day.
Bye.

# Chapter 19: Pricing
###### Transcript pulled from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5qaZdZKW84)
We are talking now today about chapter 19.
And chapter 19 has to do with pricing concepts.
So when we think of the four P's, **product, promotion, distribution or place, pricing** is the last of the four that we will be talking about this term.
And really, we could spend, I don't know, a lot amount of time on pricing, there's a
lot on pricing.
But we are just going to hit some highlights with this chapter and give you some concepts
Okay, so we are not going to get too in depth with this.
But there are some pretty important points that you need to have in your mind.
And so we are going to try to cover those today.

## Importance of price: 
Okay so, of course price is important because **price drives your sales**.
So you don't want to set your price too low, that would mean that you are leaving money
on the table.
If you've got consumers that are willing to buy your product at a higher price, and you're
selling it at too low a price, you are damaging your sales, which is damaging your profit.
And that means you have less money to use for advertising, for employee programs that
would help to keep your human resources in place in growing strong and supporting your
company.
So the way you set your price is very important.
Again, you don't want to leave money on the table, but you don't want to set your price
too high, because then you're not maximizing your sales, okay.
So we aren't going to go into all of the specifics about how you set price, but just know that it
is the driver for your revenue and for your profit, and so how you set that price is very
important.

## Price vs. Non-Price
Alright so, one thing that is very nice about price, is that it's very flexible, it's very
easy to change your sales price.
Think about changing your distribution as a comparison, when you are working with distribution,
you're setting up a whole supply chain.
So you've got vendors that supply raw materials, you've got people that may be contributing
to manufacturing, maybe helping you to move product around, warehousing it, shipping it
out to stores, you've got a collection of reseller stores, all of those players are
in place, and it takes a lot of time to get those players where they need to be, trained
the way they need to be, promoting your product they way they need to be.
And that's just very time consuming and takes some development effort on a company's part.
Well price, is not that way.


You can change price pretty quickly, and push out a new pricing scheme pretty quickly.
Change a list price, change your pricing to distributors, it gives you some very flexible
options for how to enhance your sales in a very quick way.
Alright, the danger with price competition though, is if you're going to start down the
path of just ramping your price down, well guess what, if you ramp your price down, so
will your competitors.
And so, it becomes a price war.
And at the end of a price war, **nobody's winning because nobody's making any profits**.
They may have sales, they may have market share, but if you don't have profit, again
you don't have the resources you need to keep your company running well.
And so price competition, while it's very flexible, it can also be very dangerous.
If you can fins a way to compete with your competitors on a non price basis, that will
end up working better in general because what you're doing there is you're finding something
that will build brand equity for your product or for you company.
And you're giving, you're developing a reason for consumers to pay whatever price you're
setting for your product.
And for them to be loyal to your price, or sorry, to your brand or your company.
So if you can **compete on a non price basis**, you're generally going to be better off.

So there are a couple major concepts in this chapter that relate to price.
And we are not going to go too in depth with these, but you need to have a basic understanding.
So first of all, demand has to do with how much quantity of a product consumers will
bear, or purchase, based on the price that is set for the product. (Think demand curve from econ) 
So the classic demand curve is a downward sloping to the right sort of a graph, like
this here.(TODO: Find example) 
And so while you may have different positions of this line, the classic demand and curve
will generally have the shape.
Where as price declines, quantity purchased increases.
It's not always the case, and there are exceptions.
So for example, if you have a prestige product, people are buying that product impart because
it has a prestigious price, or an esteem to it.
So if you actually, if you reduce the price too much, they will actually buy less of it.
So you have to be aware of that if you are trying to position a product that is a prestige item.
With a prestige product, here what you're going to see is that at a certain point,
if a price declines too much then actually fewer product will be purchased.
So you have this curve shape that is an inverse sort of a shape.
So quite different from the classic demand curve.

But I guess what I want to say about this is that what you're looking at here, even
with a prestige product, is the same organization on the axis.
It's looking at what is the quantity of product that will be purchased based on the price
points as they change, okay.

## Price Elasticity
So price elasticity, has to do with how sensitive consumers are to
a price change. 
So if the price declines, and that causes consumers to purchase a lot more product,
that's a very elastic price.(think gas in the 1970's oil embargo?) 

If the price declines or increases, and that doesn't create much of a change in the quantity
of the product that's purchased, that's considered an inelastic demand.
So electricity for example, electricity is a product that people have to have, they have
to heat their house, they have to be able to cook for their children, they simply have
to have electricity. 
And so you can decrease, looking at this chart here, if you decrease the price you may see
a little bit of an increase in the quantity of electricity purchased, but it's not going
to be that much.
On the other hand, look at like a recreational vehicle sort of an item.
In this case, if you reduce the price, you'll see a much larger change in the quantity purchased.
So that a quite, an elastic demand sort of a scenario.

## Margin Analysis.
I'm going to throw some terms out here at you, and again, we are not going to get very
in depth with this, but I do want you kind of to understand the concepts.
So with marginal analysis, what you're looking at here, basically, is what is the change
in revenue for a given change in cost, okay.
So in order to get at that idea, we need to define some terms.
- Fixed cost: fixed costs are the costs that a company has that don't change with respect to how many units of product are produced.
So if you are leasing a building space, that's the same whether you make five hundred units
of product or five thousand. 
So that would roll into a fixed cost.
If you have employees on salary, that salary over head and the benefit costs that go with
that, that would go in to fixed costs.
If you have hourly employees, on the other hand, that are paid based on how much product
you need to produce, you can figure that out as a variable cost.

So here's what it costs per unit of product that we make for this employee to be here.
And it will change if you are making more product, you have more of those costs or it
maybe, also raw material supplies, or any inputs to the product itself will obviously
increase as the quantity that you need to produce increases.
So that's fixed cost versus variable costs.
- Average fixed cost, you're just taking the total fixed cost and dividing that total by
the number of units.  

So if you look here at this chart average fixed costs decreases
as quantity goes up.
It's not that way with variable costs.
So average variable cost does decline as the number of units increases, but only to a point.
And then there's a point where it actually costs you more to generate more product.
So for example, think about your labor pool, you can produce so many units of product with
ten employees.
But if you want more than that number of units to be produced, you may have to pay those
employees overtime for example.
And so at that point then now your variable costs are going up.
And so you'll see that the nature of average variable costs is a "U" sort of a shape, and
we'll look at that on the next slide here.
Okay so, total cost is your average fixed cost plus your average variable cost times
the number of units that you make.
And so your average total cost is your average fixed cost plus your average variable cost,
okay.
So those are the basics.
Okay so now the marginal cost is what it costs you to make one extra unit of product.
And the marginal revenue is what extra amount of revenue do you get from producing one more unit of product.
And these tend to be quite theoretical sorts of concepts, okay.
As far as marginal costs and marginal revenue.
It's a good concept to understand, but in practice I don't know that I've seen people
get to the marginal cost, marginal revenue.
All though it will come up in conversation, because its a major theoretical point that
you do need to understand.
So let me move to the next slide here, and I kind of want to show you something.
So notice in this picture here that the marginal cost, and the average total cost have the
"U" shapes.
So that's the first thing.
They go down to a point and then they start increasing because of the nature of your capacity
being able to comfortably produce to a certain level.
Alright so, if you have one extra unit of product produced, and you get a certain amount
of money from that, but it cost you a certain amount of money to do that, as long as that
marginal revenue is greater than the marginal cost, then you're profitable, okay.
So if you look just at that little piece of formula, **marginal revenue minus marginal cost, as long as that is greater than zero, you're profitable**
So if you follow that logic, looking here at the chart, at the point where marginal
revenue equals marginal cost, that's the point where you need to stop producing.
Because if you go beyond that point, in terms of the number of units produced, you're going
to actually cost yourself more money than you're going to be bringing in in sales.
And so that's the major point I wanted to get to with the marginal analysis.

## Break-Even Analysis.
So in a basic explanation, the break-even point is the point where you are exactly equal
on the cost to produce a certain quantity of product, and the revenue that that's going
to generate.
So of course that point moves with respect to how many units you're producing.
But what you would like to have is a situation where your revenue line is exceeding your
total cost line, okay.
So if you think about the function of fixed cost and variable costs, so even if you produce
no product, you have a certain amount of fixed cost.
And on the chart here, that is this dash line that goes straight across.
You always have those fixed costs.
Well when you start producing product, you also now are adding on variable costs.
And so the total cost is the sum, that's the purple line here, it's the sum of your fixed
costs, which are always there, and then whatever your variable costs are on top of that.
So this becomes a line as your units produced go up, so will your total costs line.
Okay, so that's the first point.
But you start selling product with a production of one plus units.
And so you generally are wanting to produce more and more product in order to bring in
more and more revenue because you need that revenue line to get passed the break even
point so that you are now generating profits, which is the space between the total revenue
line on this chart, and the total costs line, okay.
So again, thinking back to this last slide, there is a point there where variable costs
start to actually cost more than the money that you are bringing in off those extra products.
And so we are not looking at that part of the chart yet, we are down to a smaller quantity
point where we're just looking at the point where you know, we have to at least sell this
many products in order to be profitable for a company, okay.
So you can calculate that, and I've given you some data points over here to plug into
a formula.
So you do need to know your total fixed costs, and you need to now your average variable
costs, and then you need to know your selling price.
So if you've got those three pieces of data, you take your fixed cost divided by your per
unit contribution to fixed cost, which is only the sells price minus the variable cost,
and so that's a lot of words.
So think about it like this, okay so, if you're selling a widget for 100 dollars, and it cost
you 50 dollars to make that widget, then the amount of your sales price that is actually
contributing to your profit, is 100 dollars minus 50 dollars, okay.
So that actually is that same thing as price minus variable cost, so that's your, I'm saying
that's the same thing as your per unit contribution toward the fixed costs, okay.
Does that make sense?
So in this example, you take the 120,000 dollar total fixed cost, divided by your contribution
margin or per unit contribution which is 40 dollars, 100 dollars minus the 60, and that
you tell you that your break even point would be 3,000 units.
So you'd have to make 3,000 units in order to be at a point where you start to be profitable.
I hope that made sense.
Definitely come find me if you still have questions on that, okay.
Alright, moving on.
So enough with the graphs, so let's talk more in theory now.
If you're going to be setting price for a product, a lot of variables factor in there
to that decision.
How do you want consumers in the market place to think about your company?
Do you want to be a prestigious sort of provider in their minds?
Which would suggest you'd have a higher price point.
Or do you want to be more of a value provider in their minds?
So a more reasonable point.
What are your marketing objectives?
In other words, what are your sales goals?
How much money do you have to bring in?
How profitable do you have to be?
Or how profitable do you have to be?
those sorts of objectives factor in to how you set your pricing.
Of course your costs will drive, to a great extent, the price that you even can offer.
But you do have to be concerned with non price marketing mix issues also.
Like we were talking about earlier, your distribution channel is quite a process to set up.
And so if you have a distribution channel that is geared toward intensive distribution,
then you are not probably going to want to set price points very high because that doesn't
lend itself well with being competitive for convenience sorts of products that are distributed
in intensive ways like that.
Okay so, advertising as well.
What is your advertising look like?
Is that meshing with the pricing that you're establishing for your product?
Okay, so those sorts of considerations have to come into play.
What are your supply chain channel partners expecting from you?
You need to be concerned with their opinions on these things.
And certainly how the customer is going to react.
Are they value conscious customers?
Are they wanting to be purchasing a prestige product?
So those things matter.
What is your competition doing?
And finally, what are the legal and regulatory issues you need to be concerned with?
Are you potentially running into competition price fixing sorts of issues that could cause
you trouble?
So you just got to keep that in mind as well.
Alright, okay so that, all of that conversation really had been more specific to a consumer
market place.
So let's think a little bit now about pricing for a business market.
So in this case, what you are generally looking at here is pricing to intermediary players
who are reselling your product, or using your product to build another product that they
resell to customers.
So in this case now, you have some discounting options available to you that you often don't
have for consumer market.
So if your intermediary partners are doing training or providing financing and other
services to the end users, you can offer them trade discounts to compensate them for some
of those benefits that they are providing.
Of course quantity discounts, if they are purchasing in large volume, you will typically
see a lower price offered to a business sort of a market.
Cash purchases are generally rewarded with a discount.
Business company's, most of the time, are buying on terms.
So they'll take possession of the product and they may not pay for it for 30 or 60 or
sometimes even 90 days.
So if you can get them to pay in cash upfront, that helps your cash flow as a company.
And often times, you'll get a discount if you can do that.
Seasonal discount, if you're business markets are purchasing from you during an off season,
when the product really isn't in demand, you might give them a discount there.
And finally, an allowance, if you have some sort of a trade in allowance, of course we're
used to these with car purchases, but maybe you have customers that have purchased an
older version of a product, and so you would allow them to take that, take the value of
that older product as the trade in allowance on a new purchase, that kind of thing.
So there's some examples there, for you guys to look at too.

## geographic and transfer pricing.
So just like I said, there's so much we could talk about with respect to pricing, but these
are a couple things you'd at least need to know the concept of.
So FOB factory, or FOB destination, you'll hear those terms thrown around.
So FOB factory means that the title to a product changes when the product leaved the factory.
And so the customer in that case is picking up the shipping because they are picking up
everything related to the product value from the time it leaves the factory, including
the shipping.
FOB destination is the case where the title transfers went and the product reaches its
destination.
So the shipper of the product is picking up the transportation costs, Which can be substantial.
I mean think about boat loads of steel, for example, that are coming from China or something
like that.
This could be many thousands of dollars worth of cost.
Okay so uniform geographic pricing is some times called the postage stamp way of pricing.
So everybody pays the same amount no matter how far it's being shipped, and so like a
single stamp you can mail it to New York, or to California, and it's going to be the
same cost.
Zone pricing, in this case scenario, you're defining some geographical zones.
And so the pricing is based on what zone you're shipping in to.
And so base point pricing in this case, this isn't really used much because it can be actually
not really ethical.
But in this case you define a base point somewhere, and you charge the shipping based on as if
it were coming from that point.
And so if you define your base point as being where the product is actually shipped from,
that's fine.
But if you define your base point as maybe the headquarters office, and it's in Michigan,
but the product is being shipped from Texas, okay there you've got a problem because it
doesn't mesh at all with actually the transportation cost.
Okay so that's base point pricing.
Freight Absorption pricing just means that the shipper is picking up some or all of the
cost of the freight in some way.
And you may do that because you want a certain customer, you may use it as a marketing tool
to entice their business.
That kind of thing.
Transfer pricing is a concept that's used a lot when you're dealing with large company's
that have multiple visions.
And often times one product from one division actually feeds another division.
So for example, when I worked for Simplot, we had a land and livestock group that grew
potatoes, we had a food group that made french fries, and so we had pricing for the cost
of the potatoes that went to the food group from the land and livestock group.
So we actually had to sell our potatoes to the food group at a certain price.
And you have to decide what that price is going to be.
You'll hear the term armslength thrown around.
So what you try to do there is set a price that interfaces with the division as if it
were a customer out in the marketplace.
So you have an armslength transaction that is fair compared with what other things you
are doing in the marketplace.
But you still have to decide on what the cost is.
So you may try to figure out what you actual full cost is, or you may kind of come up with
a standard full cost.
You may have a cost plus investment sort of a calculation, or just a market based cost.
What is going on in the market at that time for potatoes, and you would use that price.
Figuring out cost can be complicated, just ask an account.
Because the price of your inputs is always changing based on what the market is doing,
and the timing of when you buy products and when you include those costs in the calculation
can be very very important.
So if you buy a product in January, but you don't get it until February, do you count
that in your cost calculation in January when you made the purchase, or when you took possession
of the product in February, or if you have net 60 day terms, do you include it when you actually
pay the cost of the product.
All of those sorts of questions factor in to how you find your costing for a company.
And that factors in to your pricing.
So as I was saying, we could talk about pricing in some considerable depth, but just to give
you a feel, that's what transfer pricing is all about.
And that's all we are going to cover for pricing for this term.

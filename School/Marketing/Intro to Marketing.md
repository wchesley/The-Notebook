# Chapter 9: Reaching Global Markets

## Political, Legal and Regulatory Forces  
- A Countries legal and regulatory infrastructure is a direct reflection of its political climate. Varries depending on government type (democracy vs. theocracy vs. totalitarianism)
	- State-backed firms (ie. China) make up 1/3 of emerging foreign direct investments made in the last decade.  
- Laws can act as barriers of trade: ie. The EU has more strict anti-trust laws than does the US, making it more difficult for larger US companies to operate in the EU (intel has been fined for this) 	
### Top Countries to start a business: 
| Rank | Country | 
|---|---|
| 1 | United Kingdom |
| 2 | New Zeland |
| 3 | Netherlands |
| 4 | Sweden |
| 5 | Canada |
| 6 | Hong Kong |
| 7 | Denmark |
| 8 | Ireland |

- ** Import Tarrif: ** any duty levied on goods bought outside its borders and brought into the country. 
	- Tarrifs may impeed free trade between nations
	- usually used to protect domestic goods or raise revenue for host country 
- ** Quota: ** Limit on the amount of goods an importing country will accept for certain product catagores in a specific period of time. 
- ** Embargo: ** Government's suspension of trade in a particular product or with a given country. 
	- Embargoes are generally directed at specific goods or countries and are established for political, health, or religious reasons. (Think oil rations of 1970's) 
- ** Exchange Controls: ** Government restrictions on the amount of a particular currency that can be bought or sold. 
	- Developing economies use exchange control to limit speculation against their currencies and to limit foreign investment. 
- ** Balance of Trade: ** difference between a countries imports and exports
	- A negative balance of trade is considered harmful because it means U.S. dollars are supporting foreign economies at the expense of U.S. companies and workers. At the same time, U.S. citizens benefit from the assortment of imported products and their typically lower prices. As with everything, there is a trade off somewhere. 

## Ethical and Social Responsibility Forces
- Some countries still facilitate the use of payoffs and bribes to conduct business, however the UK bribery act and the US foreign corrupt practices act prevent any firm from the US or UK from participating in bribes in any way; direct or indirect. 
- differing ethical standards affect marketing efforts. ie. china's standards regarding intelectual propert (IP) differ dramatically from those in the United States, creating potential conflicts for marketers of computer software, music, and books. Trade in counterfeit goods has been estimated to be anywhere from $200 billion to more than $1.7 trillion worldwide, but the full scope is unknown according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

- Doing business in foregin contries exposes US firms to new cultures and styles of business, particularly shocking for those less traveled 
	- ** self-reference criterion (SRC) ** the unconscious reference to one’s own cultural values, experiences, and knowledge. When confronted with a situation, we react on the basis of knowledge we have accumulated over a lifetime, which is usually grounded in our culture of origin. Our reactions are based on meanings, values, and symbols that relate to our culture but may not have the same relevance to people of other cultures.
- Naturally businesses want to adapt to local cultures and do business the way that they do. However this can lead to Cultural relativism
	- ** Cultural relativism: **the concept that morality varies from one culture to another and that business practices are, therefore, differentially defined as right or wrong by particular cultures.
- Some major international firms support the ** Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) ** which racks emerging issues and trends, provides information on corporate leadership and best practices, conducts educational workshops and training, and assists organizations in developing practical business ethics tools.

## Competitive Forces 
- Competition is a staple in the market place; customers thrive on it; firms are bettered by it (only the strongest will survive) 
- Each country has unique competitive aspects (natural traits that make them better or worse in the international marketplace) 
	- Although competitors drive competition, nations establish the infrastructure and the rules for the types of competition that can take place. For example, the privacy laws in the European Union are stricter than those in the United States.
- should an internationally available product offer more features or better quality local customers will soon demand that their local markets offer the same product at the same or lower price.

# Chapter 19: Pricing
###### Transcript pulled from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5qaZdZKW84)
We are talking now today about chapter 19.
And chapter 19 has to do with pricing concepts.
So when we think of the four P's, **product, promotion, distribution or place, pricing** is the last of the four that we will be talking about this term.
And really, we could spend, I don't know, a lot amount of time on pricing, there's a
lot on pricing.
But we are just going to hit some highlights with this chapter and give you some concepts
Okay, so we are not going to get too in depth with this.
But there are some pretty important points that you need to have in your mind.
And so we are going to try to cover those today.

## Importance of price: 
Okay so, of course price is important because **price drives your sales**.
So you don't want to set your price too low, that would mean that you are leaving money
on the table.
If you've got consumers that are willing to buy your product at a higher price, and you're
selling it at too low a price, you are damaging your sales, which is damaging your profit.
And that means you have less money to use for advertising, for employee programs that
would help to keep your human resources in place in growing strong and supporting your
company.
So the way you set your price is very important.
Again, you don't want to leave money on the table, but you don't want to set your price
too high, because then you're not maximizing your sales, okay.
So we aren't going to go into all of the specifics about how you set price, but just know that it
is the driver for your revenue and for your profit, and so how you set that price is very
important.

## Price vs. Non-Price
Alright so, one thing that is very nice about price, is that it's very flexible, it's very
easy to change your sales price.
Think about changing your distribution as a comparison, when you are working with distribution,
you're setting up a whole supply chain.
So you've got vendors that supply raw materials, you've got people that may be contributing
to manufacturing, maybe helping you to move product around, warehousing it, shipping it
out to stores, you've got a collection of reseller stores, all of those players are
in place, and it takes a lot of time to get those players where they need to be, trained
the way they need to be, promoting your product they way they need to be.
And that's just very time consuming and takes some development effort on a company's part.
Well price, is not that way.


You can change price pretty quickly, and push out a new pricing scheme pretty quickly.
Change a list price, change your pricing to distributors, it gives you some very flexible
options for how to enhance your sales in a very quick way.
Alright, the danger with price competition though, is if you're going to start down the
path of just ramping your price down, well guess what, if you ramp your price down, so
will your competitors.
And so, it becomes a price war.
And at the end of a price war, **nobody's winning because nobody's making any profits**.
They may have sales, they may have market share, but if you don't have profit, again
you don't have the resources you need to keep your company running well.
And so price competition, while it's very flexible, it can also be very dangerous.
If you can fins a way to compete with your competitors on a non price basis, that will
end up working better in general because what you're doing there is you're finding something
that will build brand equity for your product or for you company.
And you're giving, you're developing a reason for consumers to pay whatever price you're
setting for your product.
And for them to be loyal to your price, or sorry, to your brand or your company.
So if you can **compete on a non price basis**, you're generally going to be better off.

So there are a couple major concepts in this chapter that relate to price.
And we are not going to go too in depth with these, but you need to have a basic understanding.
So first of all, demand has to do with how much quantity of a product consumers will
bear, or purchase, based on the price that is set for the product. (Think demand curve from econ) 
So the classic demand curve is a downward sloping to the right sort of a graph, like
this here.(TODO: Find example) 
And so while you may have different positions of this line, the classic demand and curve
will generally have the shape.
Where as price declines, quantity purchased increases.
It's not always the case, and there are exceptions.
So for example, if you have a prestige product, people are buying that product impart because
it has a prestigious price, or an esteem to it.
So if you actually, if you reduce the price too much, they will actually buy less of it.
So you have to be aware of that if you are trying to position a product that is a prestige item.
With a prestige product, here what you're going to see is that at a certain point,
if a price declines too much then actually fewer product will be purchased.
So you have this curve shape that is an inverse sort of a shape.
So quite different from the classic demand curve.

But I guess what I want to say about this is that what you're looking at here, even
with a prestige product, is the same organization on the axis.
It's looking at what is the quantity of product that will be purchased based on the price
points as they change, okay.

## Price Elasticity
So price elasticity, has to do with how sensitive consumers are to
a price change. 
So if the price declines, and that causes consumers to purchase a lot more product,
that's a very elastic price.(think gas in the 1970's oil embargo?) 

If the price declines or increases, and that doesn't create much of a change in the quantity
of the product that's purchased, that's considered an inelastic demand.
So electricity for example, electricity is a product that people have to have, they have
to heat their house, they have to be able to cook for their children, they simply have
to have electricity. 
And so you can decrease, looking at this chart here, if you decrease the price you may see
a little bit of an increase in the quantity of electricity purchased, but it's not going
to be that much.
On the other hand, look at like a recreational vehicle sort of an item.
In this case, if you reduce the price, you'll see a much larger change in the quantity purchased.
So that a quite, an elastic demand sort of a scenario.

## Margin Analysis.
I'm going to throw some terms out here at you, and again, we are not going to get very
in depth with this, but I do want you kind of to understand the concepts.
So with marginal analysis, what you're looking at here, basically, is what is the change
in revenue for a given change in cost, okay.
So in order to get at that idea, we need to define some terms.
- Fixed cost: fixed costs are the costs that a company has that don't change with respect to how many units of product are produced.
So if you are leasing a building space, that's the same whether you make five hundred units
of product or five thousand. 
So that would roll into a fixed cost.
If you have employees on salary, that salary over head and the benefit costs that go with
that, that would go in to fixed costs.
If you have hourly employees, on the other hand, that are paid based on how much product
you need to produce, you can figure that out as a variable cost.

So here's what it costs per unit of product that we make for this employee to be here.
And it will change if you are making more product, you have more of those costs or it
maybe, also raw material supplies, or any inputs to the product itself will obviously
increase as the quantity that you need to produce increases.
So that's fixed cost versus variable costs.
- Average fixed cost, you're just taking the total fixed cost and dividing that total by
the number of units.  

So if you look here at this chart average fixed costs decreases
as quantity goes up.
It's not that way with variable costs.
So average variable cost does decline as the number of units increases, but only to a point.
And then there's a point where it actually costs you more to generate more product.
So for example, think about your labor pool, you can produce so many units of product with
ten employees.
But if you want more than that number of units to be produced, you may have to pay those
employees overtime for example.
And so at that point then now your variable costs are going up.
And so you'll see that the nature of average variable costs is a "U" sort of a shape, and
we'll look at that on the next slide here.
Okay so, total cost is your average fixed cost plus your average variable cost times
the number of units that you make.
And so your average total cost is your average fixed cost plus your average variable cost,
okay.
So those are the basics.
Okay so now the marginal cost is what it costs you to make one extra unit of product.
And the marginal revenue is what extra amount of revenue do you get from producing one more unit of product.
And these tend to be quite theoretical sorts of concepts, okay.
As far as marginal costs and marginal revenue.
It's a good concept to understand, but in practice I don't know that I've seen people
get to the marginal cost, marginal revenue.
All though it will come up in conversation, because its a major theoretical point that
you do need to understand.
So let me move to the next slide here, and I kind of want to show you something.
So notice in this picture here that the marginal cost, and the average total cost have the
"U" shapes.
So that's the first thing.
They go down to a point and then they start increasing because of the nature of your capacity
being able to comfortably produce to a certain level.
Alright so, if you have one extra unit of product produced, and you get a certain amount
of money from that, but it cost you a certain amount of money to do that, as long as that
marginal revenue is greater than the marginal cost, then you're profitable, okay.
So if you look just at that little piece of formula, **marginal revenue minus marginal cost, as long as that is greater than zero, you're profitable**
So if you follow that logic, looking here at the chart, at the point where marginal
revenue equals marginal cost, that's the point where you need to stop producing.
Because if you go beyond that point, in terms of the number of units produced, you're going
to actually cost yourself more money than you're going to be bringing in in sales.
And so that's the major point I wanted to get to with the marginal analysis.

## Break-Even Analysis.
So in a basic explanation, the break-even point is the point where you are exactly equal
on the cost to produce a certain quantity of product, and the revenue that that's going
to generate.
So of course that point moves with respect to how many units you're producing.
But what you would like to have is a situation where your revenue line is exceeding your
total cost line, okay.
So if you think about the function of fixed cost and variable costs, so even if you produce
no product, you have a certain amount of fixed cost.
And on the chart here, that is this dash line that goes straight across.
You always have those fixed costs.
Well when you start producing product, you also now are adding on variable costs.
And so the total cost is the sum, that's the purple line here, it's the sum of your fixed
costs, which are always there, and then whatever your variable costs are on top of that.
So this becomes a line as your units produced go up, so will your total costs line.
Okay, so that's the first point.
But you start selling product with a production of one plus units.
And so you generally are wanting to produce more and more product in order to bring in
more and more revenue because you need that revenue line to get passed the break even
point so that you are now generating profits, which is the space between the total revenue
line on this chart, and the total costs line, okay.
So again, thinking back to this last slide, there is a point there where variable costs
start to actually cost more than the money that you are bringing in off those extra products.
And so we are not looking at that part of the chart yet, we are down to a smaller quantity
point where we're just looking at the point where you know, we have to at least sell this
many products in order to be profitable for a company, okay.
So you can calculate that, and I've given you some data points over here to plug into
a formula.
So you do need to know your total fixed costs, and you need to now your average variable
costs, and then you need to know your selling price.
So if you've got those three pieces of data, you take your fixed cost divided by your per
unit contribution to fixed cost, which is only the sells price minus the variable cost,
and so that's a lot of words.
So think about it like this, okay so, if you're selling a widget for 100 dollars, and it cost
you 50 dollars to make that widget, then the amount of your sales price that is actually
contributing to your profit, is 100 dollars minus 50 dollars, okay.
So that actually is that same thing as price minus variable cost, so that's your, I'm saying
that's the same thing as your per unit contribution toward the fixed costs, okay.
Does that make sense?
So in this example, you take the 120,000 dollar total fixed cost, divided by your contribution
margin or per unit contribution which is 40 dollars, 100 dollars minus the 60, and that
you tell you that your break even point would be 3,000 units.
So you'd have to make 3,000 units in order to be at a point where you start to be profitable.
I hope that made sense.
Definitely come find me if you still have questions on that, okay.
Alright, moving on.
So enough with the graphs, so let's talk more in theory now.
If you're going to be setting price for a product, a lot of variables factor in there
to that decision.
How do you want consumers in the market place to think about your company?
Do you want to be a prestigious sort of provider in their minds?
Which would suggest you'd have a higher price point.
Or do you want to be more of a value provider in their minds?
So a more reasonable point.
What are your marketing objectives?
In other words, what are your sales goals?
How much money do you have to bring in?
How profitable do you have to be?
Or how profitable do you have to be?
those sorts of objectives factor in to how you set your pricing.
Of course your costs will drive, to a great extent, the price that you even can offer.
But you do have to be concerned with non price marketing mix issues also.
Like we were talking about earlier, your distribution channel is quite a process to set up.
And so if you have a distribution channel that is geared toward intensive distribution,
then you are not probably going to want to set price points very high because that doesn't
lend itself well with being competitive for convenience sorts of products that are distributed
in intensive ways like that.
Okay so, advertising as well.
What is your advertising look like?
Is that meshing with the pricing that you're establishing for your product?
Okay, so those sorts of considerations have to come into play.
What are your supply chain channel partners expecting from you?
You need to be concerned with their opinions on these things.
And certainly how the customer is going to react.
Are they value conscious customers?
Are they wanting to be purchasing a prestige product?
So those things matter.
What is your competition doing?
And finally, what are the legal and regulatory issues you need to be concerned with?
Are you potentially running into competition price fixing sorts of issues that could cause
you trouble?
So you just got to keep that in mind as well.
Alright, okay so that, all of that conversation really had been more specific to a consumer
market place.
So let's think a little bit now about pricing for a business market.
So in this case, what you are generally looking at here is pricing to intermediary players
who are reselling your product, or using your product to build another product that they
resell to customers.
So in this case now, you have some discounting options available to you that you often don't
have for consumer market.
So if your intermediary partners are doing training or providing financing and other
services to the end users, you can offer them trade discounts to compensate them for some
of those benefits that they are providing.
Of course quantity discounts, if they are purchasing in large volume, you will typically
see a lower price offered to a business sort of a market.
Cash purchases are generally rewarded with a discount.
Business company's, most of the time, are buying on terms.
So they'll take possession of the product and they may not pay for it for 30 or 60 or
sometimes even 90 days.
So if you can get them to pay in cash upfront, that helps your cash flow as a company.
And often times, you'll get a discount if you can do that.
Seasonal discount, if you're business markets are purchasing from you during an off season,
when the product really isn't in demand, you might give them a discount there.
And finally, an allowance, if you have some sort of a trade in allowance, of course we're
used to these with car purchases, but maybe you have customers that have purchased an
older version of a product, and so you would allow them to take that, take the value of
that older product as the trade in allowance on a new purchase, that kind of thing.
So there's some examples there, for you guys to look at too.

## geographic and transfer pricing.
So just like I said, there's so much we could talk about with respect to pricing, but these
are a couple things you'd at least need to know the concept of.
So FOB factory, or FOB destination, you'll hear those terms thrown around.
So FOB factory means that the title to a product changes when the product leaved the factory.
And so the customer in that case is picking up the shipping because they are picking up
everything related to the product value from the time it leaves the factory, including
the shipping.
FOB destination is the case where the title transfers went and the product reaches its
destination.
So the shipper of the product is picking up the transportation costs, Which can be substantial.
I mean think about boat loads of steel, for example, that are coming from China or something
like that.
This could be many thousands of dollars worth of cost.
Okay so uniform geographic pricing is some times called the postage stamp way of pricing.
So everybody pays the same amount no matter how far it's being shipped, and so like a
single stamp you can mail it to New York, or to California, and it's going to be the
same cost.
Zone pricing, in this case scenario, you're defining some geographical zones.
And so the pricing is based on what zone you're shipping in to.
And so base point pricing in this case, this isn't really used much because it can be actually
not really ethical.
But in this case you define a base point somewhere, and you charge the shipping based on as if
it were coming from that point.
And so if you define your base point as being where the product is actually shipped from,
that's fine.
But if you define your base point as maybe the headquarters office, and it's in Michigan,
but the product is being shipped from Texas, okay there you've got a problem because it
doesn't mesh at all with actually the transportation cost.
Okay so that's base point pricing.
Freight Absorption pricing just means that the shipper is picking up some or all of the
cost of the freight in some way.
And you may do that because you want a certain customer, you may use it as a marketing tool
to entice their business.
That kind of thing.
Transfer pricing is a concept that's used a lot when you're dealing with large company's
that have multiple visions.
And often times one product from one division actually feeds another division.
So for example, when I worked for Simplot, we had a land and livestock group that grew
potatoes, we had a food group that made french fries, and so we had pricing for the cost
of the potatoes that went to the food group from the land and livestock group.
So we actually had to sell our potatoes to the food group at a certain price.
And you have to decide what that price is going to be.
You'll hear the term armslength thrown around.
So what you try to do there is set a price that interfaces with the division as if it
were a customer out in the marketplace.
So you have an armslength transaction that is fair compared with what other things you
are doing in the marketplace.
But you still have to decide on what the cost is.
So you may try to figure out what you actual full cost is, or you may kind of come up with
a standard full cost.
You may have a cost plus investment sort of a calculation, or just a market based cost.
What is going on in the market at that time for potatoes, and you would use that price.
Figuring out cost can be complicated, just ask an account.
Because the price of your inputs is always changing based on what the market is doing,
and the timing of when you buy products and when you include those costs in the calculation
can be very very important.
So if you buy a product in January, but you don't get it until February, do you count
that in your cost calculation in January when you made the purchase, or when you took possession
of the product in February, or if you have net 60 day terms, do you include it when you actually
pay the cost of the product.
All of those sorts of questions factor in to how you find your costing for a company.
And that factors in to your pricing.
So as I was saying, we could talk about pricing in some considerable depth, but just to give
you a feel, that's what transfer pricing is all about.
And that's all we are going to cover for pricing for this term.

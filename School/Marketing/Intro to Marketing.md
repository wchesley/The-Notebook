# Chapter 9: Reaching Global Markets

## Political, Legal and Regulatory Forces  
- A Countries legal and regulatory infrastructure is a direct reflection of its political climate. Varries depending on government type (democracy vs. theocracy vs. totalitarianism)
	- State-backed firms (ie. China) make up 1/3 of emerging foreign direct investments made in the last decade.  
- Laws can act as barriers of trade: ie. The EU has more strict anti-trust laws than does the US, making it more difficult for larger US companies to operate in the EU (intel has been fined for this)

- ** Import Tarrif: ** any duty levied on goods bought outside its borders and brought into the country. 
	- Tarrifs may impeed free trade between nations
	- usually used to protect domestic goods or raise revenue for host country 
- ** Quota: ** Limit on the amount of goods an importing country will accept for certain product catagores in a specific period of time. 
- ** Embargo: ** Government's suspension of trade in a particular product or with a given country. 
	- Embargoes are generally directed at specific goods or countries and are established for political, health, or religious reasons. (Think oil rations of 1970's) 
- ** Exchange Controls: ** Government restrictions on the amount of a particular currency that can be bought or sold. 
	- Developing economies use exchange control to limit speculation against their currencies and to limit foreign investment. 
- ** Balance of Trade: ** difference between a countries imports and exports
	- A negative balance of trade is considered harmful because it means U.S. dollars are supporting foreign economies at the expense of U.S. companies and workers. At the same time, U.S. citizens benefit from the assortment of imported products and their typically lower prices. As with everything, there is a trade off somewhere. 

## Ethical and Social Responsibility Forces
- Some countries still facilitate the use of payoffs and bribes to conduct business, however the UK bribery act and the US foreign corrupt practices act prevent any firm from the US or UK from participating in bribes in any way; direct or indirect. 
- differing ethical standards affect marketing efforts. ie. china's standards regarding intelectual propert (IP) differ dramatically from those in the United States, creating potential conflicts for marketers of computer software, music, and books. Trade in counterfeit goods has been estimated to be anywhere from $200 billion to more than $1.7 trillion worldwide, but the full scope is unknown according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

- Doing business in foregin contries exposes US firms to new cultures and styles of business, particularly shocking for those less traveled 
	- ** self-reference criterion (SRC) ** the unconscious reference to one’s own cultural values, experiences, and knowledge. When confronted with a situation, we react on the basis of knowledge we have accumulated over a lifetime, which is usually grounded in our culture of origin. Our reactions are based on meanings, values, and symbols that relate to our culture but may not have the same relevance to people of other cultures.
- Naturally businesses want to adapt to local cultures and do business the way that they do. However this can lead to Cultural relativism
	- ** Cultural relativism: **the concept that morality varies from one culture to another and that business practices are, therefore, differentially defined as right or wrong by particular cultures.
- Some major international firms support the ** Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) ** which racks emerging issues and trends, provides information on corporate leadership and best practices, conducts educational workshops and training, and assists organizations in developing practical business ethics tools.

## Competitive Forces 
- Competition is a staple in the market place; customers thrive on it; firms are bettered by it (only the strongest will survive) 
- Each country has unique competitive aspects (natural traits that make them better or worse in the international marketplace) 
	- Although competitors drive competition, nations establish the infrastructure and the rules for the types of competition that can take place. For example, the privacy laws in the European Union are stricter than those in the United States.
- should an internationally available product offer more features or better quality local customers will soon demand that their local markets offer the same product at the same or lower price.

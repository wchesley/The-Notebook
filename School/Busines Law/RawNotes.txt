### Litigation

Not the only way legal disputes are settled, there's also ADR (alternative dispute resolution) => Ch. 5

attornies that are really good in court room are called litigators or Trial attornies. 

Litigation helps the business community resolve actual disputes. (lawsuits)  
Lawsuits are a drain
- time
- money
- energy 
End goal of lecture: develop and understanding of litigation process.  

## Parties
- Plantiff 
    - Person who filed the suit. 
    - a **civil** action 
- defendant
    - Party being sued or 
    - Person against whom a criminal charge is filed by the state
- 3rd-Party Defendant: 
    - Brought in by the defendant
    - to complete determination of a controversy 

## Standing to sue
---
Do you really have a "dog" in this fight? 
- Entitled to have the court decide the dispute
- To Establish a standing, plaintiff must allege: 
    - Litigation involves a case or controversy 
    - Personal stake in the resolution of the controversy

case 4.1
Mayer v. Belichick
605 F.3d 223 (3rd Cir.)
Issue: 
- Videotaping the new york jets coaches and players on teh field. 
- Purpose: capturing and stealing the new yourk jets signals and visual coaching instructions
 - The New England Patriots. 

 Personal Jurisdiction
 Court must have legal authority over an individual. 
 Court has to haev authority over the parties in the case
 - *in personum* over the person
    - Personal jurisdiction over the defendant obainted by: 
        - court summons
        - Service of Process 
 - *in rem?*
 - Long arm statuetes: Provision for the service of process beyond the boundaries of the state. 

## Class-Action Suits: 
---
Many people affected by an incident (red bull didn't give us all wings!)
- One or more plaintiffs file suit on their own behalf and on behalf of all other persons who may have a similar claim. 
- No one member of the class can make suing financially worthwhile (attornies typically take 1/3 of the reward in class action)

Pretrial procedures
1. Plaintiff files complaint
2. Complaints and summons served on defendant
3. Defendant files motion or answer with possible counterclaim and defenses
4. Court rules on motions - case could be decided here and never make it to trial. 
5. Plaintiff files reply to answer. 
6. attornets conduct discovery procedures
7. Parties may file motions for summary judgment or judgement on pleadings 
8. Court conducts pretrial confrence. 

## Pleadings
- they are: 
    - Legal documents
    - filed wiht a court
    - begin litigation process
- complaint: filed by plaintiff
- answer: filed by defendant
- Default: order entered by court when defendant does not respond in any way. 
- After getting answer plaintiff must reply
    - Admits or denies each alligation of the defendants counterclaims 

## Discovery 
Gather the Evidence
- Narrows the issues disputed by the parties. 
- Ensures results of lawsuits are based on the merits of the cotroversy. 
    - not an ability or skill of counsel 
- encourage settlement. 
- Get Evidence!!!! <= THIS IS KEY!!

## Discovery methods
- Interrogatories: 
    - written questions (like written interview)
- Request for production of documents; 
    - Ask other party to produce specific documents
- Depositions: 
    - Oral questions of the possible witness. 
    - asked by attornies, will have court reporter present, but witness is not under oath. trying to impeach the witness (catch them in a lie)
- Request for admisssion
    - if you would just agree to 'x' we don't have to bring it up in court again. 

## Discovery scope
- Discovery procedures are intended to be used freely by parties without courts supervision
- Judges provide a liberal interpretation of degree of discoverable information. 
- information is considered discoverable when it can lead to Evidence admissible during a trial. 
- expensive af $$$$$$$

in a survey of 1000 judges, abusive discovery was rated highest among the reasons for the hight costs of litigation.

## Motions
- Statute of Limitations (SOL):
    - Defendant
    - Motion to dismiss suit
    - Law says plaintiff took too long to file
- Judgment on the pleadings
    - Decide case based only on the complaint and answer
- Summary Judgment    
    - Decide based on the pleadings and other evidence  
**TODO: Add Figure 4.2 from textbook - Pretrial **

**TODO: Add figure 4.3 from textbook - Trial Steps - 2 pictures from slides/book **  

## Food for thought... 
"I consider a trial by jury as the only anchor yet devised by mn, by which a government can be held to the principles of its constitution"  -Thomas Jefferson

## Jury Selection  
- Jury Summons
- **Voir Dire**: Speaking the Truth
    - Selected jurors are called into jury box to conduct the examination
- Peremptory Challenge: No cause or reason needs to be given to excuse a prospective juror

*Will ruling provide justice and a sound precedent?*  

Look at case 3.1 in book: Sebelius case regarding affordable care act. 

TODO: Add Ch 6 Notes - link Power point - Ch 1-6 Test Opens 9/17 - homework is best source of review, lots of overlap in question bank

## Test Review: 
lawyers first duty is administration of justice
commercial speech is protected under first amendment; govt can limit it; and it may not be as extensive as right of individual
under a minimum rationality approach a permissible state end is a legit goal of government. 
10th amendment reinforces federalism
libel cases deal with printed defamatory falsehoods - tabloid magazines?  or slander (spoken defaming word)
small claims courts do not require the services of a lawyer - think judge judy - not formal at all - limited by $$ amount asked for in claims
lawyer is often involved in personal decision of clients
judicial abstention; aka strict constructivism

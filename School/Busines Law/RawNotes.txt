[PowerPoint here](https://buffswtamu-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/wrchesley1_buffs_wtamu_edu/EWaskRa2XXNJobt0mhntZhoBDthfzjU_Qrm2fzhafbbFkg?email=chesley.walker%40gmail.com&e=Ca1Uaf)

### Litigation

Not the only way legal disputes are settled, there's also ADR (alternative dispute resolution) => Ch. 5

attornies that are really good in court room are called litigators or Trial attornies. 

Litigation helps the business community resolve actual disputes. (lawsuits)  
Lawsuits are a drain
- time
- money
- energy 
End goal of lecture: develop and understanding of litigation process.  

## Parties
- Plantiff 
    - Person who filed the suit. 
    - a **civil** action 
- defendant
    - Party being sued or 
    - Person against whom a criminal charge is filed by the state
- 3rd-Party Defendant: 
    - Brought in by the defendant
    - to complete determination of a controversy 

## Standing to sue
---
Do you really have a "dog" in this fight? 
- Entitled to have the court decide the dispute
- To Establish a standing, plaintiff must allege: 
    - Litigation involves a case or controversy 
    - Personal stake in the resolution of the controversy

case 4.1
Mayer v. Belichick
605 F.3d 223 (3rd Cir.)
Issue: 
- Videotaping the new york jets coaches and players on teh field. 
- Purpose: capturing and stealing the new yourk jets signals and visual coaching instructions
 - The New England Patriots. 

 Personal Jurisdiction
 Court must have legal authority over an individual. 
 Court has to haev authority over the parties in the case
 - *in personum* over the person
    - Personal jurisdiction over the defendant obainted by: 
        - court summons
        - Service of Process 
 - *in rem?*
 - Long arm statuetes: Provision for the service of process beyond the boundaries of the state. 

## Class-Action Suits: 
---
Many people affected by an incident (red bull didn't give us all wings!)
- One or more plaintiffs file suit on their own behalf and on behalf of all other persons who may have a similar claim. 
- No one member of the class can make suing financially worthwhile (attornies typically take 1/3 of the reward in class action)

Pretrial procedures
1. Plaintiff files complaint
2. Complaints and summons served on defendant
3. Defendant files motion or answer with possible counterclaim and defenses
4. Court rules on motions - case could be decided here and never make it to trial. 
5. Plaintiff files reply to answer. 
6. attornets conduct discovery procedures
7. Parties may file motions for summary judgment or judgement on pleadings 
8. Court conducts pretrial confrence. 

## Pleadings
- they are: 
    - Legal documents
    - filed wiht a court
    - begin litigation process
- complaint: filed by plaintiff
- answer: filed by defendant
- Default: order entered by court when defendant does not respond in any way. 
- After getting answer plaintiff must reply
    - Admits or denies each alligation of the defendants counterclaims 

## Discovery 
Gather the Evidence
- Narrows the issues disputed by the parties. 
- Ensures results of lawsuits are based on the merits of the cotroversy. 
    - not an ability or skill of counsel 
- encourage settlement. 
- Get Evidence!!!! <= THIS IS KEY!!

## Discovery methods
- Interrogatories: 
    - written questions (like written interview)
- Request for production of documents; 
    - Ask other party to produce specific documents
- Depositions: 
    - Oral questions of the possible witness. 
    - asked by attornies, will have court reporter present, but witness is not under oath. trying to impeach the witness (catch them in a lie)
- Request for admisssion
    - if you would just agree to 'x' we don't have to bring it up in court again. 

## Discovery scope
- Discovery procedures are intended to be used freely by parties without courts supervision
- Judges provide a liberal interpretation of degree of discoverable information. 
- information is considered discoverable when it can lead to Evidence admissible during a trial. 
- expensive af $$$$$$$

in a survey of 1000 judges, abusive discovery was rated highest among the reasons for the hight costs of litigation. 

> 09/24/2019  

## Motions
- Statute of Limitations (SOL):
    - Defendant
    - Motion to dismiss suit
    - Law says plaintiff took too long to file
- Judgment on the pleadings
    - Decide case based only on the complaint and answer
- Summary Judgment    
    - Decide based on the pleadings and other evidence  
**TODO: Add Figure 4.2 from textbook - Pretrial **

**TODO: Add figure 4.3 from textbook - Trial Steps - 2 pictures from slides/book **  

## Food for thought... 
"I consider a trial by jury as the only anchor yet devised by mn, by which a government can be held to the principles of its constitution"  -Thomas Jefferson

## Jury Selection  
- Jury Summons
- **Voir Dire**: Speaking the Truth
    - Selected jurors are called into jury box to conduct the examination
- Peremptory Challenge: No cause or reason needs to be given to excuse a prospective juror
- Strikes

### Read and add notes on Case 4.2

#### Supreme court outlawed racial discrimination in peremptory challenges
    - batson v. kentucky, 476 US 79 (1986)
#### Gender discrimination is bannedd in the jury selection process 
    - J.E.B. v. Alabama
#### 

## Opening statements
- Attorneys make opening statements
- Plaintiff introduces evidence to establish truth of allegations made in the complaint
- Directed verdict: Motion by the defendant
- Lawyers summarize the evidence
- Jury instructions: judge informing the jury with the law 

## Burden of Proof 
- Criminal cases
    - Beyond reasonable doubt
- Civil cases - subject to two standards
    - Preponderance of evidence (less evidence requried to win, OJ was found not guilty for murder, but found to have owed money in the wrongful death civil suit brought before him)
    - Clear and convincing (More proof than Preponderance but less than reasonable doubt)  ex. Guardianship disputes (rare in civil cases, mostly Preponderance)

## Deciding the case
- Jury: 
    - Determine what the facts are 
    - apply the law as __**instructed by the judge**__ 
- Verdict: Decision by the jury announced in the courtroom when jury deliberations are over. 
- Judge will decide whether to accept the verdict or not. 

## Post trial issues
- Appellant: Party appealing. (Can be plaintiff or defendant)
- Appellee: Successful party in the trial court. 
- Petitioner: Party initiating the petition when a petition for certiorari is filed to the supreme court.
    - Respondant: Opponent party in the petition
##### If you are found not guilty in criminal case: the opposing party (the government) Cannot appeal the case.  Where as if the criminal loses the case, he can appeal. 

## Appellant Procedures
- Courts of appeal deal with the record of the proceedings in lower court. 
- Courts of appeal studies the issues, testimony and proceedings to determine: 
    - Whether prejudicial errors occured or 
    - Whether lower court reached and erroneous result
- Brief: Short description of the case by each party to the trial 

## Appellate Procedures
- Oral Arguement: Specified amount of time given to attorneys to explain their position to the court. (more like debate team) 
- Vote of the judges or justices impressions is taken. 
- Each judge prepares an opinion and circulates it among the other members. 
    - when a majority ... 

#### TODO: Add Fig 4.4 - Appellate Review 

## Enforcement of judgments and decrees
- Execution: 
    - Court official seizes some property of the debtor
    - Sells it at public auction
    - Applies the proceeds to the creditor's claims 
- Garnishment: involves having a portion of the debtors wages paid to the court, which in turn pays the creditor

## *Res Judicata* 
- Case has been decided on appeal
- Time for appeal has expired. 
- A cause of action finally determined by a competent court cannot be litigated by the parties anywhere. 
- Successive suits involving the same factual setting between the same parties cannot be made as dispute has been concluded. 
- Decision of the court is final and conclusive on all issues.

> Conflicts leads to *disputes* when one party makes claim that the other denies. (usually from 2 differing points of view)

## Negotiation

    - Avoidance (ie. ghosting)
    - Accommodate 
    - Competition 
    - Collaborate
    - Compromise
    
## Positional Negotiation
- Positional bargaining: used instinctively

## Principled Negotiation
I. Communication
II. Relationship
III. Interests 
IV. Discuss all availabe options. 
V. which options are actually legit. 
VI. Consider the alternatives. 
VII. Commitment to the alternatives.  

## Alternative dispute resolution systems (ADR Systems)
- Litigation does not prevetnt the use of ADR. 
- Lawsuits are not required to use ADR methods. 
- Usage can be part of a contractual relationship between parties. (required by contract)
- Effective use can save costs associated with litigation. 

## Fig. 5.1 Scale of dispute resolution systems. 
> TODO: Add line graph from PowerPoint. 

## Arbitration
- ADR system 
- Disputing parties agree to have a third party decide the merits of the dispute
- Arbitrator: AUthorized to make decisions that are binding on the parties. 
- Helps parties avoid litigation expenses adn courtroom formalities. 
- Serves to ease congested court dockets. 
- Allows to submit several disputes to experts for solutions
- Submission: Act of referring the dispute to the Arbitrator
- Voluntary arbitration: Submission to arbitration by the parties. 
- Mandatory arbitration: Occurs when a statute or court requires parties to arbitrate. 
- Award: decision made by an Arbitrator

## Submission
- Submission by contract.  
    - Occurs when the parties enter into an agreement to arbitrate an exisiting dispute. 
- Parties can contractually agree to submit to arbitration all issues that arise in the future. 
- statuetes require Submission

## Factors that influence the selection of Arbitrators
- Get subject matter experts
- The number chosen is usually 3, but bigger cases may require more, smaller; less
- Authority over certain matters
    - Arbitrators authority is a topic of controversy and litigation. (currently disputed) 

## Case 5.1 Arbitrators Authority
- Case Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Antonio Jackson
- 130 S. Ct. 2772 (2010)
- Supreme court. 
- Issue: 
    - Jackson filed a race discrimination lawsuit in federal court instead of arbitrating his claim. 
        - he claimed that the agreement to arbitrate was unconscionable and unenforceable under nevada law. 

## Awards. 
- Decision by the Arbitrator
- Findings and reasons of the award must be disclosed if requried by the submission.  
- U.S. Supreme Court favors a broad scope of the arbitrators authority
- Final on all issues submited and enforceable by the courts 
- Not subject to judicial review on the merits of the descison 

## Federal Arbitration Act
- Encourages businesses to use ADR (encourages courts to do the same with cases that should be settled)
- Impact on Policy
    - FAA covers any arbitration clause in a contract that involves interstate commerce. 
    - Courts should enforce arbitration agreements. 
    - Federal policy favors arbitration of commercial disputes. 
- Impact on state laws. 
    - Some state laws specify that designated matters are not to be submitted for arbitration
    - Commerce Clause and supermecy clause of the US constitution invalidate state laws that deny arbitration 

## Case 5.2

## Statutorily Mandated Arbitration
- Certain statues requrie arbitration of specific subject matter 
- States statues require mandatory arbitration for certain types of disputes 
- Viable alternative for controlling court congestion
- ARbitrators are retired judges and practicing lawyers.

School corporation was considered to be the bailee for some pieces of art, went on so long that the actual ownership of the art was in question, school claimed they've had it so long that they own it now. no terms were set on bailment. 
> TL;DR put term limits in the contract to avoid that shit!

## Substantive Law and Procedural Law  
Substantive Law - realationship of people with other people or with the state, ex. Property law  
Procedural Law - method and means by which Substantive law is made and administered.  ex. Rules of Evidentiary Procedure, administrative law  (machinery that enforces substative law)

## Federal Law
Constitution - top law of US -  
Legislation - 2nd -  
administrative law or regulations - last in list of authority for laws.  

## State Law - ordered top to bottom, most authorative to least. 
* State Constitution  
* Statutes or Acts  
* Regulatory law of state and administrative agencies  
* ordinances (county or city)  

## Judicial Decisions or Case law
* interpret Constitutional, Legislative and Regulatory laws
* opinions: decisions made by judges on legal issues. 
    - Becomes `precedents` for future cases involving similar facts and legal issues
    - Citation: address for locating the case in a library or a computer database. ex: `3 cai. R. 175, 2 Am. Dec. 264 (N.Y. 1805)` Translates to  Pierson v. Post (the Foxhunt case used as an example in class)  
* Advantages:  
    * Stare decisis 
        - Judges follow precedents whenever possible. 
        - Ensures certainty and predictability in the law
    * Specifies boundaries of Property-based legal system
* Disadvantages:  
    * Volume of cases  
    * Conflicting precedents  
    * **Conflicts of Law** 
    * Distinction between **holding** and **dicta** Increased difficutly of determining the precedent  
    * Rejection of precedent - Rare, but it can happen (*Constitutional Relativity vs Originalism*) 
> dicta is extra stuff in a case that is not holding
Holding can set precedents, dicta does not

Systems of Ethics: 
* Formalism: `affirms absolute Morality`
    * Duty based view, if you have a duty, do it!
    * Categorical Imperative  
    * Social Contract - Idea that we all kinda have a contract with eachother, ie. i have my rights but no right to 'step' on your rights  
* Consequentialialism - Concerned with moral consequnces of actions
    * Utilitarianism
    * Protestant ethic

Ethics influences legal system: Is there a relationship between law and ethics? Yes.

Organizational code of ethics
* Business have adopted ethical codes at the individual organizational level
* More important than creating a code:  
    * Effective implementation!

> TODO: Import image from pp  
Should I do it?
* Is it right or wrong? 
* WIll I be proud if they found out
* How would I feel if everyone did it? 
* Will it cause harm? 
* Is it legal?   

Obstacles: 
* Profits vs. Ethics
* Group think - if everyone else is doing it...might as well...mob mentality
    * Individuals feel less responsible  
* Control of resources by non-owners (potential conflics of interest)
    * Managerial agents can manipulate resoures in their own interest. 
    * Self-dealing

* Personhood rights of a corporation have been recognized in the law. 
    * Corporation is an individual
* Does this mean that a corporation can have values and all the individual employees must agree with them? 
* What about laws for corporations that force individuals to violate religious values? 

# Chapter 3 - The Court System

> 09/03/2019  

## Judges and Justices
* two terms are not synonomous
* individuals who operate the courts
* Trial Court  
    * Judges  
    * Determines the rules of law for a case   
* Appellate Court
    * Justices  
    * Review case (as if they are grading papers from the judges)  
    * apeals courts do not have jury, one or more Justice will decide the case. Some attornies will specialize in Appellate cases  
    * decide an appeal and provide reasons for their decisions.  

## Jurors
* Fact-finding body
* Trial by jury is guaranteed by the Bill of Rights. 

> 09/05/2019  

### Jurors contd...   
* Petit Jury: Trial jury that returns a verdict in criminal and civil stiuations. (usually 12 people, civil might have 6, varies between states/counties)  
* Decisions must be unanimous (called hung if it's not a unanimous decision)  
    * leads to mistrial where prosicution can retry the case if they want to.  
    * don't have to provide reasons for guilt/innocence 

## Lawyers  
* Primary duty is to the administration of Justice. 
* Present: 
    * Evidence
    * Points of law (they think judge/court should focus on)
* Make arguments
* Assist juries and judge in making decisions (jury: what facts are true? Judge: What laws are relevent?)
* Serve as counsellors, advocates, and public servants. 
* Serve as representative advocates in court system
* confidential communications with clients (client attorny privilege)
    * rules of Evidence
    * attorney-client privilege   
        * forbids a Lawyer to reveal confidential facts and testify against a client. 
    * work product doctrine
        * protects some documents of expert witnesses (drafts)

## Organization of the court system

1. Supreme court  
2. Appellate courts. 
3. Trial courts.  

> Is the state supreme court always the highest court in that state. 
No. not always! Sometimes they have a different name or appeal system. 
Texas has seperate courts for criminal and civil courts.   

## Subject matter jurisdiction
* Power over the case issues. 
* jurisdiction can be limited to: 
    * A specific subject matter
    * area in which the party lives (some areas with large and diverse populations will have static probate judges (specialize in wills/guardianship))  
* Examples: 
    * Probate courts: Wills and estates
    * Traffic courts: Traffic violations 

Fig. 3.1 - State Court System
TODO: Move over flow chart from PP 
#### *Term to know: Centori: a writ or order by which a higher court reviews a decision of a lower court.*

## Federal courts review: 
1. if the US is involved as a party 
2. state vs. state 
3. Citizens of different states (ammount in controversy(ie. amounts greater than $75K), diversity of citizenship)  
4. Law: Federal Question 

## Diversity of citizenship 
* Diversity 
    * Plaintifs / defendants are citizens of different states. 
    * To reach federal court: each claim must be $75K+ 
    * guard against state court bias.  

## Federal Question cases: 
* US Constitution issues ie. (Miranda vs. Arizona => Miranda rights)
* Federal Statue issues
* no $$$ limits.  

Fig. 3.2 Federal Court System
TODO: Move over flowchart from PP / book 

## District courts
* Trial courts of the federal system. 
* One court in every state and the Distric of Colombia. 
* *Federal Rules of Civil Procedure:* Provide the details concerning procedures to be followed in federal court litigation. 

## Appellate courts
TODO: Get Geographical boundries for Appellate courts. 
* 12 courts of appeal
* Special court of appeals hears appeals from 
    * special courts. 
    * Administrative decisions
* Other courts have been created to handle the special subject matter.
    * Court of appeals for armed forces. 
* Texas is in the 5th circuit for court of appeals (apparently we rival the 9th district? (california - west coast?))

> General role of an appelate court is to: 
    Review questions of law. 

## Decisions by the US Supreme Court. 
*SCOTUS:* Supreme court of the united states.  
* review requires a petition for a writ of Certiorari
* Supreme court resolves
    * cases involving major Constitutional issues 
    * interpretation of federal law. 
* Final judgments of hightes state ourt are reviewed only by SCOTUS. 

## Power of judical review. 
* Judicial restraint vs. judical activism
* power should not be used except in unusual cases vs. Power should be used when the needs of society justify it. 
### US Supreme court has the ultimate power to invalidate actions by the President or Congress. 

## Judical restraint: 
* Courts have a limited role. 
* conservative 
* Pragmatic approach to litigation.
* Societal changes through polical process. 
* synonomous with: *Strict constructionism* or *judicial abstention*

## Judicial activism
* Liberal
* Courts have expansive role
* Policy directed / Result concious 
* Value oriented. 
* precedent  

## Nature of the judical process
1. Case to be decided. 
    * use existing statutes and precedents
    * create a law where none exist. 
    * Refusal to apply case law or find unconstitutional   
*Will ruling provide justice and a sound precedent?*  

Look at case 3.1 in book: Sebelius case regarding affordable care act.

## Exam 1 Review: 
lawyers first duty is administration of justice  
commercial speech is protected under first amendment; govt can limit it; and it may not be as extensive as right of individual  
under a minimum rationality approach a permissible state end is a legit goal of government.   
10th amendment reinforces federalism  
libel cases deal with printed defamatory falsehoods - tabloid magazines?  or slander (spoken defaming word)  
small claims courts do not require the services of a lawyer - think judge judy - not formal at all - limited by $$ amount asked for in claims  
lawyer is often involved in personal decision of clients  
judicial abstention; aka strict constructivism

# Chapter 4  
###### Exam 1 Due Tonight 9/19 by 11:59pm
[PowerPoint here](https://buffswtamu-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/wrchesley1_buffs_wtamu_edu/EWaskRa2XXNJobt0mhntZhoBDthfzjU_Qrm2fzhafbbFkg?email=chesley.walker%40gmail.com&e=Ca1Uaf)

## Litigation

Not the only way legal disputes are settled, there's also ADR (alternative dispute resolution) => Ch. 5

attornies that are really good in court room are called litigators or Trial attornies. 

Litigation helps the business community resolve actual disputes. (lawsuits)  
Lawsuits are a drain
- time
- money
- energy 
End goal of lecture: develop and understanding of litigation process.  

## Parties
- Plantiff 
    - Person who filed the suit. 
    - a **civil** action 
- defendant
    - Party being sued or 
    - Person against whom a criminal charge is filed by the state
- 3rd-Party Defendant: 
    - Brought in by the defendant
    - to complete determination of a controversy 

## Standing to sue
Do you really have a "dog" in this fight? 
- Entitled to have the court decide the dispute
- To Establish a standing, plaintiff must allege: 
    - Litigation involves a case or controversy 
    - Personal stake in the resolution of the controversy

Case 4.1
*Mayer v. Belichick*
605 F.3d 223 (3rd Cir.)
Issue: 
- Videotaping the new york jets coaches and players on teh field. 
- Purpose: capturing and stealing the new yourk jets signals and visual coaching instructions
 - The New England Patriots. 

 Personal Jurisdiction
 Court must have legal authority over an individual. 
 Court has to haev authority over the parties in the case
 - *in personum* over the person
    - Personal jurisdiction over the defendant obainted by: 
        - court summons
        - Service of Process 
 - *in rem?*
 - Long arm statuetes: Provision for the service of process beyond the boundaries of the state. 

## Class-Action Suits: 

Many people affected by an incident (red bull didn't give us all wings!)
- One or more plaintiffs file suit on their own behalf and on behalf of all other persons who may have a similar claim. 
- No one member of the class can make suing financially worthwhile (attornies typically take 1/3 of the reward in class action)

Pretrial procedures
1. Plaintiff files complaint
2. Complaints and summons served on defendant
3. Defendant files motion or answer with possible counterclaim and defenses
4. Court rules on motions - case could be decided here and never make it to trial. 
5. Plaintiff files reply to answer. 
6. attornets conduct discovery procedures
7. Parties may file motions for summary judgment or judgement on pleadings 
8. Court conducts pretrial confrence. 

## Pleadings
- they are: 
    - Legal documents
    - filed wiht a court
    - begin litigation process
- complaint: filed by plaintiff
- answer: filed by defendant
- Default: order entered by court when defendant does not respond in any way. 
- After getting answer plaintiff must reply
    - Admits or denies each alligation of the defendants counterclaims 

## Discovery 
Gather the Evidence
- Narrows the issues disputed by the parties. 
- Ensures results of lawsuits are based on the merits of the cotroversy. 
    - not an ability or skill of counsel 
- encourage settlement. 
- Get Evidence!!!! **<= THIS IS KEY!!**

## Discovery methods
- Interrogatories: 
    - written questions (like written interview)
- Request for production of documents; 
    - Ask other party to produce specific documents
- Depositions: 
    - Oral questions of the possible witness. 
    - asked by attornies, will have court reporter present, but witness is not under oath. trying to impeach the witness (catch them in a lie)
- Request for admisssion
    - if you would just agree to 'x' we don't have to bring it up in court again. 

## Discovery scope
- Discovery procedures are intended to be used freely by parties without courts supervision
- Judges provide a liberal interpretation of degree of discoverable information. 
- information is considered discoverable when it can lead to Evidence admissible during a trial. 
- expensive af **$$$$$$$**5

in a survey of 1000 judges, abusive discovery was rated highest among the reasons for the hight costs of litigation. 

> 09/24/2019  

## Motions
- Statute of Limitations (SOL):
    - Defendant
    - Motion to dismiss suit
    - Law says plaintiff took too long to file
- Judgment on the pleadings
    - Decide case based only on the complaint and answer
- Summary Judgment    
    - Decide based on the pleadings and other evidence  
**TODO: Add Figure 4.2 from textbook - Pretrial **

**TODO: Add figure 4.3 from textbook - Trial Steps - 2 pictures from slides/book **  

## Food for thought... 
"I consider a trial by jury as the only anchor yet devised by mn, by which a government can be held to the principles of its constitution"  -Thomas Jefferson

## Jury Selection  
- Jury Summons
- **Voir Dire**: Speaking the Truth
    - Selected jurors are called into jury box to conduct the examination
- Peremptory Challenge: No cause or reason needs to be given to excuse a prospective juror
- Strikes

### Case 4.2

> 564 U.S. _(2011)  
> *Wal-Mart Stores v. Dukes*  

One of the most expensive class action lawsuits ever.   
3 current or former walmar employees allege that the company discriminated against them on the basis,  
of their sex by denying them equal pay or promotions.  
**violates Title VII of Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended...**    
was not directed at corporate policy but local managers discretion over pay and promotion  
that was excersised disproportionately towards men.  
this was overturned as there weren't enough people to justify class action law suit.  
They took data from all walmart managers from accross all 50 states and had varying results.  
some women did better and some were worse off.  
Justice Ginsberg offerd this dissenting opinion:  
> She emphasized that the majority opinion "disqualifies the class at the starting gate"  
because it puts too much burden on the plaintiffs to show how their individual  
claims are sufficiently similar to form a class action.
>  
She was joined by Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan. 

#### Supreme court outlawed racial discrimination in peremptory challenges
    - batson v. kentucky, 476 US 79 (1986)
#### Gender discrimination is bannedd in the jury selection process 
    - J.E.B. v. Alabama
#### 

## Opening statements
- Attorneys make opening statements
- Plaintiff introduces evidence to establish truth of allegations made in the complaint
- Directed verdict: Motion by the defendant
- Lawyers summarize the evidence
- Jury instructions: judge informing the jury with the law 

## Burden of Proof 
- Criminal cases
    - Beyond reasonable doubt
- Civil cases - subject to two standards
    - Preponderance of evidence (less evidence requried to win, OJ was found not guilty for murder, but found to have owed money in the wrongful death civil suit brought before him)
    - Clear and convincing (More proof than Preponderance but less than reasonable doubt)  ex. Guardianship disputes (rare in civil cases, mostly Preponderance)

## Deciding the case
- Jury: 
    - Determine what the facts are 
    - apply the law as __**instructed by the judge**__ 
- Verdict: Decision by the jury announced in the courtroom when jury deliberations are over. 
- Judge will decide whether to accept the verdict or not. 

## Post trial issues
- Appellant: Party appealing. (Can be plaintiff or defendant)
- Appellee: Successful party in the trial court. 
- Petitioner: Party initiating the petition when a petition for certiorari is filed to the supreme court.
    - Respondant: Opponent party in the petition
##### If you are found not guilty in criminal case: the opposing party (the government) Cannot appeal the case.  Where as if the criminal loses the case, he can appeal. 

## Appellant Procedures
- Courts of appeal deal with the record of the proceedings in lower court. 
- Courts of appeal studies the issues, testimony and proceedings to determine: 
    - Whether prejudicial errors occured or 
    - Whether lower court reached and erroneous result
- Brief: Short description of the case by each party to the trial 

## Appellate Procedures
- Oral Arguement: Specified amount of time given to attorneys to explain their position to the court. (more like debate team) 
- Vote of the judges or justices impressions is taken. 
- Each judge prepares an opinion and circulates it among the other members. 
    - when a majority ... 

#### TODO: Add Fig 4.4 - Appellate Review 

## Enforcement of judgments and decrees
- Execution: 
    - Court official seizes some property of the debtor
    - Sells it at public auction
    - Applies the proceeds to the creditor's claims 
- Garnishment: involves having a portion of the debtors wages paid to the court, which in turn pays the creditor

## *Res Judicata* 
- Case has been decided on appeal
- Time for appeal has expired. 
- A cause of action finally determined by a competent court cannot be litigated by the parties anywhere. 
- Successive suits involving the same factual setting between the same parties cannot be made as dispute has been concluded. 
- Decision of the court is final and conclusive on all issues. 

# Chapter 5 - Alternative Dispute Resolution
> 09/24/2019  
[PowerPoint here](https://buffswtamu-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/wrchesley1_buffs_wtamu_edu/EY_iJjizoxRBoyGhn1swV7UB5LyPsPhv1Esh4PzDBG9n-g?email=chesley.walker%40gmail.com&e=z148mg)

> Conflicts leads to *disputes* when one party makes claim that the other denies. (usually from 2 differing points of view)

## Negotiation
- Process used to persuade or coerce someone.  
- Conflict Styles - we all have a dom conflict style but typically use all conflict styles. 
    - Avoidance (ie. ghosting)
    - Accommodate 
    - Competition 
    - Collaborate
    - Compromise
    
## Positional Negotiation
- Positional bargaining: used instinctively
- begins in competitive style
- Does *not* focus on underlying conflicts 

## Principled Negotiation
I. Communication  
II. Relationship  
III. Interests   
IV. Discuss all availabe options.   
V. which options are actually legit.   
VI. Consider the alternatives.   
VII. Commitment to the alternatives.    

## Alternative dispute resolution systems (ADR Systems)
- Litigation does not prevetnt the use of ADR. 
- Lawsuits are not required to use ADR methods. 
- Usage can be part of a contractual relationship between parties. (required by contract)
- Effective use can save costs associated with litigation. 

## Fig. 5.1 Scale of dispute resolution systems.

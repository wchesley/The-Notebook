  <h3 style="color:#F96302">Static and Dynamic Routing</h3>

  <p>Routing can be classified by how entries are added to the routing table. There are three types of routing entriesâ€”default,
  static and dynamic. You can use default, static and dynamic routing together.</p>

  <p>Information about other networks can be added to the routing table using one of two methods:</p>

            <li>A route entry of 0.0.0.0 identifies the default entry or default route which is special form of a static
            entry.</li>
            <li>Static entries remain in the routing table until they manually removed.</li>
            <li>When changes to the network occur, static entries must be modified, added, or removed.</li>

          Maintaining static only routing in a large network with multiple routers would be very difficult, especially when there
          are multiple network paths that an IP packet can take to get to its destination. Routers can dynamically learn about
          networks by sharing routing information with other routers.
          <ul>
            <li>Dynamic routing is implemented by enabling a routing protocol.</li>
            <li>A routing protocol adds dynamic entries to the routing table.</li>
            <li>If multiple paths to a network are available, routing protocols define:

                <li>The algorithm used to calculate a metric.</li>
                <li>How routers communicate with each other to share network path information.</li>

| Protocol                                           | Type | Category        | Description |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---- | --------------- | ---|
| Routing Information Protocol (RIP)                 | IGP  | Distance Vector | RIP is a distance vector routing protocol used for routing within an autonomous system (such as an IGP). RIP uses hop count as the metric. RIP network size is limited to a maximum of 15 hops between any two networks. A network with a hop count of 16 indicates an unreachable network. RIP v1 is a classful protocol; RIP v2 is a classless protocol. RIP is best suited for small private networks. |
| Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) | IGP  | Hybrid          | EIGRP is a hybrid routing protocol developed by Cisco for routing within an AS. EIGRP uses a composite number for the metric, which indicates bandwidth and delay for a link. The higher the bandwidth, the lower the metric. EIGRP is a classless protocol. EIGRP is best suited for medium to large private networks. |
| Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)                    | IGP  | Link State      | OSPF is a link state routing protocol used for routing within an AS. OSPF uses relative link cost for the metric. OSPF is a classless protocol. OSPF divides a large network into areas. Each autonomous system requires an area 0 that identifies the network backbone. All areas are connected to area 0, either directly or indirectly through another area. Routes between areas must pass through area 0. Internal routers share routes within an area; area border routers share routes between areas; autonomous system boundary routers share routes outside of the AS. A router is the boundary between one area and another area. OSPF is best suited for large private networks. |
| Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) | IGP  | Link State      | IS-IS is a link-state routing protocol used for routing within an AS. IS-IS uses relative link cost for the metric. IS-IS is a classless protocol. The original IS-IS protocol was not used for routing IP packets; use integrated IS-IS to include IP routing support. IS-IS divides a large network into areas. There is no area 0 requirement, and IS-IS provides greater flexibility for creating and connecting areas than OSPF . L1 routers share routes within an area. L2 routers share routes between areas. An L1/L2 router can share routes with both L1 and L2 routers. A network link is the boundary between one area and another area. IS-IS is best suited for large private networks; it supports larger networks than OSPF. IS-IS is typically used within an ISP and easily supports IPv6 routing. |
| Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)                      | EGP  | Hybrid          | BGP is an advanced distance vector protocol (also called a path vector protocol). BGP is an exterior gateway protocol (EGP) used for routing between autonomous systems. BGP uses paths, rules, and policies instead of a metric for making routing decisions. BGP is a classless protocol. Internal BGP (iBGP) is used within an autonomous system; External BGP (eBGP) is used between autonomous systems. BGP is the protocol used on the internet; ISPs use BGP to identify routes between autonomous systems. Very large networks can use BGP internally, but typically share routes on the internet only if the AS has two (or more) connections to the internet through different ISPs.                                                                                                                        |

  <h3 style="color:#F96302">Routing Protocol Categories</h3>

  <p>There are two primary categories of gateway protocols, distance vector protocols and link state protocols. A third category is
  a combination of these two, hybrid protocols. There is only one popular exterior routing protocol, and it is a hybrid
  protocol.</p>

  <p>The difference in these categories of routing protocols is:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>How metric values are calculated</li>

    <li>How path information is shared between routers</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style="color:#F96302">Distance Vector Routing Protocols</h3>

  <p>Distance vector routing protocols:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Set a metric value or cost based on how far away a network is.
      <ul>
        <li>Are generally measured by hop count.</li>
        <li>May measure distance by delay, packets lost, or something similar.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Set a direction that is associated with the distance.
      <ul>
        <li>Direction refers to the network interface that is used to forward the IP packet to the distant network.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>When using a distance vector protocol, a router:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Will only share information with its direct neighbors (the next hop routers).</li>
    <li>Will share all route information that it knows about.
      <ul>
        <li>Directly connected routes</li>
        <li>Routes learned from its direct neighbors</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Will send route information at a regularly scheduled time.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Convergence occurs when all routers share a consistent view of the network. Each router will used converged path information
  to insert next hop information for each learned path into the routing table. It does this by choosing the route with the lowest
  metric.</p>

  <h3 style="color:#F96302">Link State Routing Protocols</h3>

  <ol>
	<li>Link state protocols are also known as shortest path first protocols. The following is the general process employed by a
  router that uses link state protocols for finding best hop information.</li>
	<li>The router examines its directly connected network links and assigns a metric value.
      <ul>
		<li>The metric value is based on the status and connection type of the link.</li>
		<li>The metric value may also include other factors, such as bandwidth and delay.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>The router determines the neighbor routers that are connected by each direct network link.</li>
	<li>The router builds a link-state packet (LSP) that contains a list of its neighbors and the metric value of the link to that
    neighbor.</li>
	<li>Through a process called flooding, the router sends the LSP to its neighbor routers.</li>
	<li>Neighboring routers, in turn, sends the LSP to its neighbors, and so on.
	<ul>
		<li>To eliminate looping, each router forwards the packet to every neighbor except the one it received the packet
        from.</li>
		<li>A smart flooding algorithm prevents looping when there are circular routing paths.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Using converged route information, the router constructs a complete map of the routing topology.</li>
	<li>From this map, the router will calculate the best path to each destination network.
      <ul>
		<li>Best path is determined using Dijkstrasâ€™s algorithm, which calculates the shortest path first.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Using the link-state protocol, the router uses the best path information to insert next hop information for each network
    path into the routing table.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3 style="color:#F96302">Administrative Distance</h3>

  <p>When more than one protocol is enabled on a router, each protocol is given an administrative distance. When 
	the best
  path is being determined, protocols with a lower administrative distance are chosen over those with a higher administrative distance.</p>

  <p>Most routers have a default administrative distance assigned to each routing protocol.</p>

  </ul>

  <h3 style="color:#F96302">How NAT Works</h3>

  <p>NAT works by translating private addresses to the public address of the NAT 
	router.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Hosts on the private network share the IP address of the NAT router or a pool of addresses assigned for the network.</li>
    <li>The NAT router maps port numbers to private IP addresses. Responses to internet requests include the port number appended
    by the NAT router. This allows the NAT router to forward responses back to the correct private host.</li>
    <li>Technically speaking, NAT translates one address to another. Port address translation (PAT) associates a port number with
    the translated address.
      <ul>
        <li>With only NAT, you would need a public address for each private host. NAT associates a single public address with a
        single private address.</li>
        <li>PAT allows multiple private hosts to share a single public address. Each private host is associated with a unique port
        number on the NAT router.</li>
        <li>Because virtually all NAT routers perform PAT, you normally use PAT, and not just NAT, when you use a NAT router.
        (NAT is usually synonymous with PAT.)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style="color:#F96302">Implementing NAT</h3>

  <p>When you implement NAT, be aware of the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>NAT supports a limit of 5,000 concurrent connections.</li>
    <li>NAT provides some security for the private network because it translates or hides private addresses.</li>
    <li>A NAT router can act as a limited-function DHCP server, assigning addresses to private hosts.</li>
    <li>A NAT router can forward DNS requests to the internet.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The following table describes three types of NAT implementation. </p>

| Type                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Dynamic NAT            | Dynamic NAT automatically maps internal IP addresses with a dynamic port assignment. On the NAT device, the internal device is identified by the public IP address and the dynamic port number. Dynamic NAT allows internal (private) hosts to contact external (public) hosts, but not vice versaâ€”external hosts cannot initiate communications with internal hosts. This implementation is also sometimes called many-to-one NAT because many internal private IP address are mapped to one public IP address on the NAT router.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Static NAT (SNAT)      | Static NAT maps a single private IP address to a single public IP address on the NAT router. Static NAT is used to take a server on the private network (such as a web server) and make it available on the internet. Using a static mapping allows external hosts to contact internal hostsâ€”external hosts contact the internal server using the public IP address and the static port. This implementation is called one-to-one NAT because one private IP address is mapped to one public IP address. In addition to static NAT, the term SNAT also means source NAT, stateful NAT, and secure NAT. Although the terms vary, the function is the same. One commonly used implementation of static NAT is called port forwarding. Port forwarding allows incoming traffic addressed to a specific port to move through the firewall and be transparently forwarded to a specific host on the private network. Inbound requests are addressed to the port used by the internal service on the router's public IP address (such as port 80 for a web server). This is often called the public port. Port forwarding associates the inbound port number with the IP address and port of a host on the private network. This port is often called the private port. Based on the public port number, incoming traffic is redirected to the private IP address and port of the destination host on the internal network. Port forwarding is also called destination network address translation, or DNAT. |
| Dynamic and Static NAT | Dynamic and static NAT, where two IP addresses are given to the public NAT interface (one for dynamic NAT and one for static NAT), allows traffic to flow in both directions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

<h3 style="color:#F96302">Reserved Private IP Addresses</h3>

<p>When connecting a private network to the internet through NAT, IP addresses on the private network are commonly those reserved
by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for that purpose. These address ranges are guaranteed not to be used on the
internet and do not need to be registered. The private IPv4 address ranges are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>10.0.0.1 to 10.255.255.254</li>
    <li>172.16.0.1 to 172.31.255.254</li>
    <li>192.168.0.1 to 192.168.255.254</li>

  <p>A general routing problem symptom is the inability to access hosts on a specific network or any remote network. In this lesson,
  you will learn how to troubleshoot a few routing problems:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Can't access hosts outside the local subnet.</li>

    <li>Can't communicate with any host on a specific network.</li>

    <li>Can't access the internet.</li>

    <li>Remote clients can't access network resources.</li>

  </ul>

<h3 style="color:#F96302">Troubleshooting Strategies</h3>

<p>The following table presents a general troubleshooting strategy for each of 
these routing issues.</p>

        <td class="centered">Can't access hosts outside the local subnet</td>
        <td class="content">
          If one or more hosts can communicate only with hosts on the local subnet, the problem is likely with the default gateway
          configuration.
          <ul>
            <li>If a single host is having problems, check the default gateway setting on that host.</li>
            <li>If multiple hosts are having problems, check the default gateway setting and verify that the DHCP server is
            configured to deliver the correct default gateway address.</li>
            <li>If all hosts have the same problem and the default gateway setting is correct, verify that the default gateway
            server is up and configured for routing.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This issue could also be caused by problems with the neighbor discovery (ND) protocol.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Routers on the same link use the ND protocol to advertise their existence to neighboring routers and to learn about
            the existence of their neighbors.</li>
            <li>Routers process ND messages to identify the link layer addresses of neighboring devices that are directly connected
            to the router.</li>
            <li>Routers use the ND protocol to periodically send and receive small hello packets to and from neighboring routers.
            If hello packets are not received from a particular router, it is
    		assumed that the router is not functioning. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Issues with the ND protocol can occur when a large subnet is used for point-to-point links between routers, especially
          when IPv6 is used. By convention, a /64 prefix is used on each subnet when implementing IPv6, allowing for a very large
          number of hosts on the subnet. If you use a standard /64 prefix on the link subnet, the ND protocol will try to perform
          address resolution for all possible hosts on the subnet. When this happens, newly connected devices may not be recognized
          by other routers for a long period of time.</p>
          <p>A point-to-point link between routers is composed of only two interfaces, one on each end of the link. Therefore, the
          link subnet needs only to support a maximum of two hosts. As a recommended best practice, use a very small subnet for the
          point-to-point link between routers to reduce ND traffic. The recommendation is to use 127-bit (/127) prefixes on these
          links instead of the conventional 64-bit prefix.</p>

        <td class="content">
          If hosts are unable to contact hosts on a specific subnet but they can communicate with other subnets, try the
          following:
          <ol>
    		<li>Verify that the router connected to the subnet is up.</li>
    		<li>Use the <b>route</b> command on the default gateway of the local subnet and verify that the router has a route to
            the remote subnet. If necessary, configure a routing protocol so that the route can be learned automatically or
            configure a static route.</li>
    		<li>Use <b>traceroute</b> to view the route taken to the destination network. Identify the last router in the path
    		and
            then troubleshoot routing at that point.</li>
    		<li>Check for routing loops in the path to the destination network. A routing loop is caused by a misconfiguration in
            the routers along the path, causing data to be sent back along the same path rather than forwarded to the destination.
            Routing loops are indicated by:
    		<ul>
    			<li>Routing table entries that appear and then disappear (called
    			<i>route flapping</i>), often at regular intervals
                (such as every minute).</li>
    			<li>Routing table entries where the next hop router address oscillates (switches) between two or more different
                routers.
                  <blockquote class="info">Routing loops are displayed in a <b>traceroute</b> output and shows the same sequence of routers being
                    repeated.
                  </blockquote></li>
    		</ul></li>
    		<li>Check for black hole routers. A
             black hole router causes the ping utility to send an ICMP echo packet that has the IP "Do not Fragment" or DF
                bit set.</li>
    			<li><b>-l</b> sets the buffer (or payload) size of the ICMP echo packet. Specify this size by typing a number after
                the <b>-l</b> parameter.</li>
    		The ping test will provide you with helpful information:
    		<ul>
    			<li>If the MTU of every segment of a routed connection is at least the MTU size, the packet is successfully
                returned.</li>
    			<li>If there are intermediate segments that have smaller MTUs, and the routers return the appropriate ICMP destination unreachable packet, the ping utility displays the message, "Packet needs to be
                fragmented but DF set."</li>
    			<li>If there are intermediate segments that have smaller MTUs and the routers do not return the appropriate ICMP
                "destination unreachable" packet, the ping utility displays the message, "Request timed
                out."</li>

            <li>Verify that the internet connection is up.</li>
            <li>Check for a default route on the router connected to the internet. A default route is indicated by a network
            address of 0.0.0.0 with a mask of 0.0.0.0. The default route is used for packets that do not match any other entries in

          <blockquote class="info">
            Most routers that connect private networks to the internet do not know about specific networks and routes on the
            internet. Additionally, most routers do not share routes for private subnets with
    		internet routers. A router is
            configured with a single default route that is used for all internet traffic, and a router at the ISP is responsible
            for sharing a single route for your private network with other internet routers.

## Dotnet & VSCode:
### Using .NET Core in Visual Studio Code

.NET Core provides a fast and modular platform for creating server apps that run on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Use Visual Studio Code with the C# and F# extensions to get a powerful editing experience with C# IntelliSense, F# IntelliSense (smart code completion), and debugging.
### Prerequisites

Install the following:

- .NET Core. You will need both the Runtime and the SDK.
- The C# extension from the VS Code Marketplace.
- The F# extension (Ionide) from the VS Code Marketplace.
